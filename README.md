## Issue reporting

Use github issues https://github.com/skyrod-vactai/kcats/issues if that's easiest.

Recommended: Instead of opening a github issue, create a fork and add a TODO subheading to the Issues heading in the respective `.org` file. You can edit org files right on github, in your own fork.


* For bugs add issues here under Issues heading in production.org
* For documentation problems add issues here under Issues heading in book-of-kcats.org

Then submit it as a pull request. 

To see the status, check your PR. It will have more commits by the developers added to it.

## Other feedback

Please do report design improvements you'd like to see - for example, inconsistencies in how words expect stack arguments to be, ways to make the standard library easier to work with, etc.
