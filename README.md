## Issue reporting

Instead of opening a github issue, add a TODO subheading to the Issues heading in the respective `.org` file. Commit the change and submit it as a pull request. In the branch where that issue is being fixed, it will be changed to INPROGRESS. When the issue is fixed, the heading will be removed. (If you disagree that it's been fixed, submit a PR that reverts the commit to remove it).

You can edit this file right on github, in your own fork of the project, if you prefer.

Why do things this weird way? I don't want to rely on github, nice as it is.

## Other feedback

Please do report design improvements you'd like to see - for example, inconsistencies in how words expect stack arguments to be, ways to make the standard library easier to work with, etc.
