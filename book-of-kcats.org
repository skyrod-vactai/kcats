* Benefits
** Easy for beginners
Kcats is designed to require learning as few concepts as
possible. It's made with:

+ Stacks
+ Data values (numbers, strings, bytes)
+ Lists
+ Functions
+ Pipes

All of these are combined in various ways to achieve any type of
expression, the same way a few types of lego bricks can be combined to
make any object.[fn:1]

Kcats code has a simple structure with only function names, data
literals and quotation marks. [fn:2]

Format code however you want, kcats doesn't care. 

Interactive development is encouraged. The documentation for the
standard library can be queried with the language itself. See
[[Exploring]].

[fn:1] Inspired by Alan Kay's quote "Lisp isn't a language, it's a
building material".
[fn:2] Function names can and do have symbols, eg =+= for addtion, but
it's just a name and it's not part of the language syntax. You can
change the name to something else very easily. There are some symbols
currently in the language that are implementation detail leaks that
will be removed as soon as a suitable replacement is found (for
example, byte array literals are base64 encoded strings with a prefix
of =#b64=, which comes from EDN syntax, which is what kcats is currently
using for serialization). 
** Powerful
Kcats' metaprogramming facilities (programs that write programs) allow
you to express yourself succinctly.
** Excels in the small
Many programming languages require you to write special setup code
before you can do actual work. With kcats, there's no "ceremony" - you
just write what you want to do. Here's a program that reads a database
file of contacts, and finds contacts that are at least 55 years
old. The program is only 9 words.

#+begin_src kcats
  "contacts.kcats" slurp read [[age] üîç 55 >=] üß≤ ‚ñ∂Ô∏è   
#+end_src

* Fundamentals
** Key terminology
- item :: A unit of information (aka value) of various types: numbers,
  strings, byte arrays, words, characters, and lists. (examples: =5=,
  ="Bob"=, =swap=, =[1 2 3]=)
- list :: An item that contains other items, in a particular order
  (delimited by square braces). Example: =[a "foo" 2]=.
- program :: a list of instructions intended to be carried out by a
  machine. (example: =[[odd?] filter]=).
- stack :: A list with a first-in, first-out interface. This is where
  the program stores all the data it needs to manipulate.
- word :: causes the program to do something, usually taking some
  items from the top of the stack, and using them to create new stack
  items. Words can be represented as actual english words, or math
  symbols or even emoji. (examples: =üîÄ=, =+=, =over=)
- axiom word :: A word not defined in terms of other words.
- definition :: what a word is supposed to do, represented either in
  the base language for axiom words, or as a program.
- dictionary :: a set of available words and their definitions.
- environment :: the entire state of an executing program, which
  includes a stack, program, and dictionary.
- pipe :: A conduit to communicate between environments, and to the
  outside world. Items are put into pipes and emerge somewhere else
  (another environment, a file on disk, a remote machine, etc).

** The stack
kcats uses a stack to keep track of all the values it needs to work
with, instead of variables and function parameters. To manipulate
data, you put it onto a stack, and then words operate on the items at
the top of the stack (which might remove, shuffle, replace, or add new
items). If you're familiar with functions in other languages, that's
all words are - they're a function of the current stack, and they
return a new stack.

Here's a simple example. If we mentally execute the program below, we
first put =1= onto the stack. Then we put =2= onto the stack. =2= is now on
top of =1=. Then we put the word =+= onto the stack, where it will consume
the =2= and the =1=, and leave their sum, =3=.

#+BEGIN_SRC kcats :results code :exports both
1 2 +
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
3
#+end_src

Multiple steps are accomplished just by adding more words and
data. For example, in the program below we can add =1= and =2= (leaving =3=
on the stack), and then multiply by =5=, leaving =15=.

#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both
1 2 + 5 *
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
15
#+end_src

Here's how it would look step by step (where the =|= separates the
program that hasn't run yet - on the right, from the stack on the
left). The stack's top item is just to the left of the =|=.

#+begin_src kcats
  ;; stack |  remaining program
  ;; ------|--------------------
           | 1 2 + 5 * 
         1 | 2 + 5 * 
       1 2 | + 5 *
         3 | 5 *
       3 5 | *
        15 |  
#+end_src

When there is nothing remaining to the right of the =|=, the program
is finished. The result is what is left on the stack (in this case
=15=).

Note the stack can end up with multiple items. When it's printed, it
will always start with the top of the stack - the last thing in is the
first thing out.

#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both
1 2 3
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
3 2 1
#+end_src

Lists are denoted with square brackets, like =[1 2 3]=. When
encountered, they just go onto the stack as a single unit. Words can
operate on lists once the list is on the stack. You can see below the
word =üîó= joins two lists into one.

#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both

  {"prompt":"What structure does kcats use to store values instead of variables?","answer":"A single stack."}
  {"prompt":"True or false: kcats relies on variables to hold data.","answer":"False. It keeps all data on a stack."}
  {"prompt":"How does kcats keep track of the values it works with?","answer":"By pushing them onto a stack rather than using variables or parameters."}
  {"prompt":"Where must data be placed before words can operate on it in kcats?","answer":"On the stack; words work on the top items."}
  {"prompt":"True or false: Words in kcats act only on items at the top of the stack.","answer":"True. They consume or rearrange the top elements."}
  {"prompt":"Why must you push data to the stack before executing a word?","answer":"Because words can only access and manipulate the top of the stack."}
  {"prompt":"In kcats, what do words conceptually take as input and produce as output?","answer":"They take the current stack and return a new stack."}
  {"prompt":"Yes or no: A kcats word can be viewed as a stack-to-stack function.","answer":"Yes. Each word maps one stack state to another."}
  {"prompt":"How are words analogous to functions in other languages?","answer":"They accept the current stack as argument and yield an updated stack."}
  {"prompt":"What does the '+' word do to the top two numbers on the stack?","answer":"It removes them and pushes their sum."}
  {"prompt":"True or false: '+' in kcats leaves the stack unchanged.","answer":"False. It pops two numbers and pushes their sum."}
  {"prompt":"How does '+' transform the stack contents?","answer":"By replacing the top two numbers with their sum."}
  {"prompt":"When does a kcats program end?","answer":"When no words remain to execute; the remaining stack is the output."}
  {"prompt":"True or false: Execution continues in kcats until the stack is empty.","answer":"False. It stops when the program stream is empty; leftover stack items are results."}
  {"prompt":"What determines the result of a completed kcats program?","answer":"The contents left on the stack once all words have run."}
  {"prompt":"If a stack holds multiple items, which item is printed first?","answer":"The top of the stack, i.e., the most recently pushed."}
  {"prompt":"Yes or no: kcats prints the bottom of the stack first.","answer":"No. It prints from the top downward."}
  {"prompt":"Which order does kcats use when printing a stack with several values?","answer":"Last-in-first-out: top item first, then the rest in order."}
  {"prompt":"How do you write a list literal in kcats?","answer":"Enclose items in square brackets, e.g. [1 2 3]."}
  {"prompt":"True or false: The tokens inside [1 2 3] are pushed individually.","answer":"False. The entire bracketed list is pushed as one value."}
  {"prompt":"Which notation tells kcats to treat several items as one list value?","answer":"Wrapping them in square brackets."}
  {"prompt":"What does the üîó word do to the top two lists?","answer":"It concatenates them into a single list."}
  {"prompt":"Yes or no: üîó merges two lists into one.","answer":"Yes. It links the two lists into one longer list."}
  {"prompt":"How can you join two lists sitting on the stack?","answer":"Use the üîó word to concatenate them."}
#+end_src
** Emoji
You'll notice in the earlier examples there's a fair number of
pictograms (emoji). kcats uses emoji pictographs instead of english
words for some commonly used functions. They are treated just like any
other word, except more colorful and succinct.

To get started we'll explain what a few of these emoji mean, that are
used in the next section.

+ üîÄ swaps the top two stack items.
+ ‚ñ∂Ô∏è executes a program snippet.
+ üë• duplicates the top stack item.
+ üöú Run the same program snippet on each item in a list. (Why a
  tractor? Tractors have different attachments, to perform the same
  task like tilling, harvesting etc, on every row of the field)
+ ü™Ñ Magically makes the top item disappear while executing the
   program beneath, then magically makes the item reappear.

Words in the dictionary that are made with emoji will have english
documentation that you can search for, in case you forget which symbol
it is. For example:

So now we know =üîÄ= does the swapping.

know that you can run it yourself and replace ="swap"= with whatever

** Exploring
*** Overview
Now that we know the very basics, we can explore and learn as we
go. kcats lets you treat the standard library (the dictionary) as
data, and you can process it with... itself. Documentation is in
there. You just need to know how to ask for it. So here's how you do
it, and you'll understand how exactly it works later.

In all the examples in this document, you can run them on the command
line, by running =kcats -p=, followed by the program in single quotes,
like this:

#+begin_example
kcats -p 'dictionary lingo [first] üöú ‚ñ∂Ô∏è [] sort'
#+end_example

In case you want to view it in its entirety, the standard library is
part of the source, it lives in [[file:lexicon.org][the lexicon]] file.
*** What words or functions are available?
This program retrieves the dictionary of the current environment, and
prints just the name of each, sorted in alphabetical order.

#+end_src

Even though the rest of this document will explain a lot of these
words and how they work, the above program does the following:

+ =dictionary= retrieves the currently active dictionary
+ =lingo=  returns the active words of the dictionary on the stack
+ =[first] üöú=: for each word/definition pair in the
  dictionary, take the =first=, which is the word. 
+ =[] sort=: sort takes a program to transform each item in the list
  it's sorting, to use for comparison. We want to use the word itself
  for comparison, so we don't need to transform it at all, hence the
  empty program.
*** What inputs/outputs does a particular word have?
The specification of a word's input and output types is stored in the
dictionary too. It's in the property called =spec=. Let's say you're
interested in the word =swap=.

#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both
dictionary lingo [üîÄ spec] üîç
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[[[item a]
  [item b]]
 [[item b]
  [item a]]]
#+end_src

What this program does is fetches the dictionary words, then looks up
the =swap= definition, then within that definition, looks up the =spec=
property.

In the result, what we have here is two lists - the spec of the
input, and the spec of the output. 

The input spec is =[[item a] [item b]]=. The output spec is =[[item b]
[item a]]=. What it's telling you is that it requires two items on the
stack, any two, we'll call them =a= (on top) and =b= beneath. There may be
more items below that but they won't be touched. When swap is
finished, =a= and =b= will have their places swapped so that =b= is on
top. And in fact that's what we get:

#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both
"b" "a" üîÄ
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
"b" "a"
#+end_src

For more details see [[Spec]].

Remember the top of the stack is printed first, and so =b= is now on top.

The format of an input or output spec is a list of either a type or a
type/name pair. For example, an input spec of =[[integer age] [string
name]]= means the function takes an integer representing an 'age' on
top of stack, and a string representing a name beneath that. The names
are for documentation only. You can also leave out any name eg
=[integer string]= is functionally the same spec, just less
descriptive. Not all inputs or outputs need to be named, =[integer
[string name]]= is also a valid input spec.

Some words have arbitrary stack effects because, for example, they run
an arbitrary program or replace the stack. The output spec for these
types of words are specified as =[*]=. Some examples of such words are =‚ñ∂Ô∏è=
or =restore=.

#+end_src

This is a list of examples, and each example is a pair or triple:

+ A program that calls the given word
+ A program that doesn't call the word that gives the same result [fn:3]
+ An optional description of what the example is demonstrating

[fn:3] Why is it done this way instead of just giving a program and
its expected result? Some expected results don't have literal
representations, so we can't directly input them, we have to calculate
them from the input.
*** Continuing exploration
Use the same technique to explore other words. You can simply replace
the word in the code snippets above with some other word.  Here's how
you find the examples for ===, which tests for equality of two items -
just replaced =swap= with ===.

** Data types
*** Types
**** Words
In kcats, words can be either in the dictionary, or not. 

Dictionary words are verbs, and they are used directly in the
execution of programs. For example: =üë•= and =üîÄ=

#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both
  1 üë• 2 üîÄ
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
1 2 1
#+end_src

Non-dictionary words are only used inside lists, often as field
names. These words can't be executed, because they're not in the
dictionary and not intended to be. They're used more like you'd use
strings or keywords in other programming languages.

#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both
  [foo bar baz] [quux] üç´ üìÆ 
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[foo bar baz quux]
#+end_src

Note the use of =üç´= here. What does the chocolate bar mean? Let's find out!

#+begin_src kcats
dictionary lingo [üç´] üîç
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
  [[definition builtin_üç´]
   [doc "The unwrapped chocolate bar denotes unwrapping a container to place all the items inside on the stack."]
   [examples [[[[1] üç´] [1] "Unwrap a list of one item"]
              [["foo" ["bar" "baz"] üç´] ["foo" "bar" "baz"] "Unwrap a list of strings with existing stack items"]
              [["foo" üî≥ üç´] ["foo"] "Unwrap an empty list is a no-op"]
              [[[1 2 3] üç´] [1 2 3] "Unwrap a list of multiple items"]]]
   [namespace #b64 "core"]
   [spec [[list] [*]]]]
#+end_src

Ok from the examples we see it unwraps the list on top of the stack,
splicing its contents into the stack. (the emoji is a partially
unwrapped chocolate bar, so that's where the unwrapping concept comes
from).

What about =üìÆ=?
#+begin_src kcats
dictionary lingo [üìÆ] üîç
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[[definition builtin_üìÆ]

 [examples [[[üî≥ 1 üìÆ] [[1]] "Put integer into empty list"] [[[1 2 3] 4 üìÆ] [[1 2 3
                                                                           4]] "Put integer into list"] [["foo" \d üìÆ] ["food"] "Put character into string"]
            [["foo" encode 32 üìÆ string] ["foo "] "Put byte into byte array"]]]
 [namespace #b64 "core"]
 [spec [[item receptacle]
        [receptacle]]]]
#+end_src

We see from the examples that =üìÆ= puts an item into a container. What's
wrong with just trying to =üìÆ= =quux= directly into the list?

#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both
  [foo bar baz] quux üìÆ
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[[asked [quux]]
 [handled üî≥]
 [reason "word is not defined"]
 [type error]
 [unwound [quux üìÆ]]]
[foo bar baz]
#+end_src

The problem is that as soon as kcats reaches =quux=, it tries to execute
it as a verb. =quux= is not in the dictionary, so it fails to execute. 

What we want is to get =quux= onto the stack by itself, without actually
executing it. We can do that with =[quux] üç´=. The word =üç´= removes the
list wrapper and leaves a bare word on the stack. Another way to go
about this is to use =üîó=, so we don't need =üç´=:

#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both
  [foo bar baz] [quux] üç´ üìÆ
#+end_src

#+end_src
**** Booleans
Most programming languages have special built-in values =true= and =false=
with privileged status in the language. kcats does not. Instead, kcats
uses container emptiness to determine logical truth - an empty
container acts like =false=, and anything else acts like =true=. For
convenience, the word =‚úÖ= (which is just a regular word that puts
itself on the stack) is conventionally used throughout the standard
library to represent an affirmative value, but it has no special
status in the language's semantics.

Here's an example of checking boolean values:

#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both
  [] ["yes"] ["no"] ‚ÜîÔ∏è
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
"no"
#+end_src
versus
#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both
  "anything" ["yes"] ["no"] ‚ÜîÔ∏è
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
"yes" "anything"
#+end_src

Notice that when we branch on a boolean value, if we get the negative
value, it's not preserved (because we already know what it must be - an empty container),
but the affirmative value is kept.

But wait, what about this?

#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both
 3 odd?
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
‚úÖ
#+end_src

Some action words will return the word =‚úÖ= (meaning affirmative), but
as we said earlier, it's not really a boolean, it's just the word
=‚úÖ=.

#+begin_src kcats
‚úÖ
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
‚úÖ
#+end_src

Use empty list =[]= to indicate logical negative. There is an emoji you
can use interchangeably with =[]=: üî≥. It nicely complements the check
mark (as in, an empty checkbox).

**** Containers
***** Overview
Containers are types that contain other items. Some containers are
homogenous. For example, strings are a container for characters and if
you try to put anything else in it, that's an error. Other containers
can hold any kind of item, for example lists and sets.

#+begin_src js :exports no
  {"prompt":"What is a container in kcats?","answer":"A container is a type whose value holds other items."}
  {"prompt":"True or false: in kcats a container is a type that holds other items.","answer":"True."}
  {"prompt":"How does kcats define a container type?","answer":"As a type whose instances contain other items."}
  {"prompt":"What happens if you put a non-character into a string in kcats?","answer":"It raises an error because strings are homogeneous containers for characters only."}
  {"prompt":"True or false: strings in kcats can store any type of item.","answer":"False. Strings are homogeneous and may only hold characters."}
  {"prompt":"Which container type is homogeneous, accepting only characters?","answer":"The string type."}
  {"prompt":"Which containers can hold any kind of item in kcats?","answer":"Lists and sets; they are heterogeneous containers."}
  {"prompt":"True or false: lists in kcats are restricted to a single item type.","answer":"False. Lists can contain items of any type."}
  {"prompt":"How do lists and sets differ from strings regarding item types they hold?","answer":"Lists and sets are heterogeneous and accept any item type, whereas strings accept only characters."}
#+end_src
***** Lists
Lists are multiple items bound up into a single unit, where their
order is maintained. Lists are heterogenous and can accept any type,
including other lists.

******* Comprehension
See the word =ü™ú=, which converts a program into one that runs on each
item in a list.

#+begin_src kcats
  0 [12 6 13 7 5] [+] ü™ú ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
43
#+end_src

Similar to =ü™ú=, but more strict, is =üöú=, which only allows the program
to work on a given item and can't permanently alter the rest of the
stack. Use that to transform each item in a list, in the same way (in
this case showing the remainder when dividing by 5).

  {"prompt":"How is a group of items stored so their order stays intact in kcats?","answer":"They are placed in a list, which binds them into one ordered unit."}
  {"prompt":"Can kcats lists hold mixed types?","answer":"Yes. Lists are heterogeneous and may contain any type, including other lists."}

  {"prompt":"True or false: Programs run under üöú may modify items outside the current element.","answer":"False. üöú restricts programs so only the current element can be affected."}
  {"prompt":"Why is üöú described as more strict than ü™ú?","answer":"Because it isolates each element‚Äôs run, preventing lasting changes to the surrounding stack."}
  {"prompt":"What common use does üöú have with respect to list elements?","answer":"It‚Äôs used to transform every item in a list, returning a list of the results."}
  {"prompt":"Yes/No: üöú can serve as a mapping operator over a list.","answer":"Yes. It applies a program to each element and collects the transformed items."}
  {"prompt":"When would you choose üöú for list processing?","answer":"When you need to apply the same operation to each element while keeping the rest of the stack intact."}
#+end_src

***** Strings
Strings are a container for character types, and work much like in
other programming languages. Most of the functions that work on other
containers will work on strings.

#+begin_src kcats 
  "Hello World!" üìè
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
12
#+end_src

#+begin_src kcats

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
\H
#+end_src

#+begin_src kcats
"Hello World" 0 5 slice
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
"Hello"
#+end_src

***** Bytes (byte array)
Byte arrays are a sort of "lowest common denominator" data
format. It's what you use to interact with files or sockets. Byte
arrays are printed in base64 encoding and denoted as such with the
=#b64= tag. You can encode any item into bytes.

#+begin_src kcats
"Hello World!" encode
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
#b64 "SGVsbG8gV29ybGQh"
#+end_src

#+begin_src kcats
[1 2 3] encode 
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
#b64 "MSAyIDM"
#+end_src

and you can treat those byte arrays as lists of integers:

#+begin_src kcats
  #b64 "SGVsbG8gV29ybGQh" üì§
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
72 #b64 "ZWxsbyBXb3JsZCE"
#+end_src

72 is the ASCII encoding for =H=.
***** Associations
An association is made from a list of pairs, like this:
#+begin_src kcats
  [[name "Alice"]
   [age 24]
   [favorite-color "brown"]]
#+end_src

However there are some words you can use that make this list behave a
bit differently than a normal list. For example:

#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both
  [[name "Alice"]
   [age 24]
   [favorite-color "brown"]]

  [age] 25 assign
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[[age 25]
 [favorite-color "brown"]
 [name "Alice"]]
#+end_src

Here we use =assign= to reset Alice's age - it does not simply add a new
item to the list.  It will find the existing key and replace it. It
will create a new item only if the key didn't already exist:

#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both
  [[name "Alice"]
   [age 24]
   [favorite-color "brown"]]

  [department] "Sales" assign 
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[[age 24]
 [department "Sales"]
 [favorite-color "brown"]
 [name "Alice"]]
#+end_src

Note that the order of the items is not preserved. Here we take a
key/value pair out of the association but which one we get is
arbitrary:
#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both
  [[name "Alice"]
   [age 24]
   [favorite-color "brown"]]

  [department] "Sales" assign üì§ 
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[favorite-color "brown"]
[[age 24]
 [department "Sales"]
 [name "Alice"]]
#+end_src

Once you treat a list as an association, it "sticks" (see [[Promotion]]
for details). It acts like an association from then on, and order is
no longer maintained.

We can improve upon our example that incremented Alice's age
(presumably after her birthday) with the word =update=. That will run a
program on the item of whatever key (or keys) you specify.

#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both
  [[name "Alice"]
   [age 24]
   [favorite-color "brown"]]

  [age] [inc] update
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[[age 25]
 [name "Alice"]
 [favorite-color "brown"]]
#+end_src

Note that associations and lists look the same when printed, but
testing them for equality will reveal they are not the same:

#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both
  [[name "Alice"]
   [age 24]
   [favorite-color "brown"]]

  [age] [inc] update

  [[name "Alice"]
   [age 25]
   [favorite-color "brown"]]

  =
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
üî≥
#+end_src

Here we are comparing an association with a list. The === operator has
no way of knowing whether you want the list semantics (which does care
about order), or the association semantics (which doesn't care about
order). It defaults to the more strict rules, so they are not equal.

The act of using a list as an association (by applying words to it
like =assign= or =update=) will convert it to an association, but what if
you just want to convert a list to an association, without doing
anything else?

You can use the word =association= to convert the list to an association:

#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both
  [[name "Alice"]
   [age 24]
   [favorite-color "brown"]]

  [age] [inc] update

  [[name "Alice"]
   [age 25]
   [favorite-color "brown"]]

  {"prompt":"True or false: assign always appends a new pair even when the key exists.","answer":"False. assign replaces an existing key‚Äôs value; it only adds a pair if the key is missing."}
  {"prompt":"How does assign differ from simply adding a pair to a list?","answer":"assign updates the value for an existing key instead of creating a duplicate; otherwise it inserts the pair."}
  {"prompt":"Does a kcats association preserve item order?","answer":"No. Associations are unordered and operations may rearrange pairs arbitrarily."}
  {"prompt":"True or false: Item order is preserved in an association.","answer":"False. Order is not maintained once the data is treated as an association."}
  {"prompt":"Why can‚Äôt you rely on element order within an association?","answer":"Because associations are unordered; their implementation does not keep pairs in original sequence."}
  {"prompt":"When you pop a pair from an association, which one is returned?","answer":"An arbitrary key/value pair; the language makes no guarantee about which pair you‚Äôll get."}
  {"prompt":"Yes or no: Popping from an association yields a predictable first element.","answer":"No. The pair returned is arbitrary because the collection is unordered."}
  {"prompt":"Which pair will a pop operation return when used on an association?","answer":"Any pair‚Äîthe choice is unspecified since associations don‚Äôt store an ordered sequence."}
  {"prompt":"What happens after you use assign or update on a list?","answer":"The list is promoted to an association and retains association behaviour thereafter."}
  {"prompt":"True or false: After assign, the structure still behaves like a normal list.","answer":"False. Once assign (or update) is used, it behaves as an association."}
  {"prompt":"Why does order stop mattering once you apply association words to a list?","answer":"Because the list is converted to an association, whose semantics ignore ordering."}
  {"prompt":"What is the purpose of the word \"update\" in an association?","answer":"update runs a supplied program on the value of the specified key(s) and stores the result."}
  {"prompt":"Yes or no: update executes a program on targeted association values.","answer":"Yes. update applies the provided code to the values of the given key(s)."}
  {"prompt":"How does update modify an association entry?","answer":"It executes the given program on the value for each specified key, replacing each with the new result."}
  {"prompt":"Do printed representations distinguish lists from associations?","answer":"No. They look identical when printed, even though they are different types."}
  {"prompt":"True or false: A list and an association with identical pairs print differently.","answer":"False. Their printed forms are the same, though they differ semantically."}
  {"prompt":"Why can equality testing reveal a difference unseen in printed output?","answer":"Because print formats match, but list and association types differ, so comparison operators can show inequality."}
  {"prompt":"Why does the = operator report a list and identical-looking association as unequal?","answer":"= defaults to order-sensitive list semantics, so the unordered association fails to match."}
  {"prompt":"True or false: = compares using association semantics by default.","answer":"False. It uses stricter list semantics unless told otherwise."}
  {"prompt":"How does the default behaviour of = affect equality between list and association?","answer":"It applies list rules that care about order, causing a list and an association with the same pairs to be unequal."}
  {"prompt":"What does the word \"association\" do when applied to a list?","answer":"It converts (promotes) the list into an association without altering its data."}
  {"prompt":"Yes or no: The word \"association\" can promote a list to an association.","answer":"Yes. Invoking association changes the list‚Äôs type to an association."}
  {"prompt":"How can you convert a list to an association without changing its data?","answer":"Use the word association; it promotes the list to an association in one step."}

***** Sets
Sets are made to test for membership, and do not care about order. 
#+begin_src kcats

*** Promotion
Data types are automatically converted when needed.

For example, if you have a list of pairs and you use the word =üîç=,
it assumes your intention is to use the list as an associative data
type, so it will be automatically converted, and remain converted
after =lookup= completes.

You can often tell by the spec when the return type is a promoted
type:
#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both
dictionary lingo [assign spec] üîç
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[[[item value]
  [list keys]
  sized]
 [association]]
#+end_src

Here you can see that the spec for =assign= takes a =sized= and returns an
=association=. This allows you to do things like this:

#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both
[[name "Susie"] [age 25]] [sport] "bowling" assign
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[[age 25]
 [name "Susie"]
 [sport "bowling"]]
#+end_src

The initial value of =[[name "Susie"] [age 25]]= is not an =associative=,
it's just a =list=. You could explicitly convert it using the word
=association= but =assign= will do it for you, because it is a function
that operates on an associative type.

Note that the conversion can fail, because converting to =associative=
requires that you have a list of pairs. If you don't, that's an error:

#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both
["foo" "bar"] [age] 25 assign
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[[actual "foo"]
 [asked [pair]]
 [handled []]
 [reason "type mismatch"]
 [type error]
 [unwound [assign]]]
25 [age] ["foo" "bar"]
#+end_src

The most common promotion is from =list= to =associative= but there are
others.

  {"prompt":"How are data types handled when a word needs a different type in kcats?","answer":"kcats automatically converts (promotes) the data to the required type."}
  {"prompt":"True or false: kcats will automatically promote a value to another data type when appropriate.","answer":"True. The runtime performs implicit type conversion when needed."}
  {"prompt":"Why can you usually supply a mismatched type to a kcats word and still succeed?","answer":"Because kcats performs automatic type promotion when the word expects another type."}
  {"prompt":"What happens when you apply üîç to a list of pairs?","answer":"The list is implicitly converted to an associative type and stays associative after lookup."}
  {"prompt":"Yes or no: After using üîç, the list you queried remains an associative structure.","answer":"Yes. The implicit promotion is permanent for that value."}
  {"prompt":"How does kcats obtain an associative from a list of pairs during lookup?","answer":"By auto-converting the list to an associative type when üîç is invoked."}
  {"prompt":"How can you spot that a word returns a promoted type just by reading its spec?","answer":"The spec explicitly shows the promoted return type, signalling automatic conversion."}
  {"prompt":"True or false: A kcats word‚Äôs spec can indicate that its result is a promoted type.","answer":"True. The type signature reveals when promotion occurs."}
  {"prompt":"Why might you examine a word‚Äôs spec before using it with mixed data types?","answer":"Because the spec tells you whether the word will return a promoted type."}
  {"prompt":"What will assign do if given a plain list of pairs instead of an association?","answer":"assign automatically converts the list to an associative type before updating it."}
  {"prompt":"True or false: You must call association before using assign on a list of pairs.","answer":"False. assign promotes the list to an association for you."}
  {"prompt":"How does assign let you skip explicitly calling association?","answer":"It implicitly converts a list of pairs to an associative type as part of its operation."}
  {"prompt":"What error occurs if kcats tries to convert a non-pair list to associative?","answer":"A type mismatch error is raised because the conversion to associative cannot succeed."}
  {"prompt":"Yes or no: Implicit promotion to associative always works, even on lists without pairs.","answer":"No. It fails with a type mismatch if the list is not made of pairs."}
  {"prompt":"Why can implicit conversion to associative sometimes fail?","answer":"Because it requires a list composed solely of pairs; otherwise kcats throws a type error."}
  {"prompt":"Which promotion is most common in kcats‚Äô automatic conversions?","answer":"Converting a list to an associative type is the most frequent promotion."}
  {"prompt":"True or false: List‚Üíassociative is the only automatic promotion kcats performs.","answer":"False. It is the most common, but other promotions exist."}
  {"prompt":"When is list-to-associative promotion typically encountered?","answer":"It is the standard and most frequent automatic type upgrade performed by kcats."}
#+end_src
*** Spec
kcats lets you see what the input an output for a given word should
look like. You can specify what kinds of data should be at each place
on the stack, both before and after the word executes.

Let's look at an example, for =+= that adds numbers:

#+begin_src kcats
dictionary lingo [+ spec] üîç 
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[[number number]
 [number]]
#+end_src

That means, the input is two numbers, and the output is one number. In
terms of stack locations, the top of the stack comes first in the
input or output spec.

When the actual stack values don't match, we get an error due to the
spec check:

#+begin_src kcats
"foo" "bar" +
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[[actual "bar"]
 [asked [number?]]
 [handled üî≥]
 [reason "type mismatch"]
 [trace üî≥]
 [type error]
 [unwound [+]]]
"bar" "foo"
#+end_src

Currently only input specs are enforced, and all specs are optional
(they default to =[[][]]= which means "don't look at any stack
items".

Specs can get more complicated, for example, instead of just
specifying a type =number=, they can give a helpful name like =[number
x]=.  Names that match should be the equal values - for example:

#+begin_src kcats
dictionary lingo [üë• spec] üîç
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[[[item a]] [[item a]
             [item a]]]
#+end_src

The word =üë•= takes an item called =a=, and leaves two items called =a=. So
we can see =üë•= duplicates the item on top of the stack.

Sometimes the word executes another program on the stack, that's not
known until runtime, and therefore we can't predict what effect it
will have. Specs show this unknown effect with =*=. For example:

#+begin_src kcats
  dictionary lingo [ü™Ñ spec] üîç
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[[program [item a]]
 [[item a]
  ,*]]
#+end_src

In this case, all we know about the output is =[item a]= will be on the
top of the stack, what's beneath that depends on what the =program=
does.
*** Traits
 There are words that operate on multiple types, and it's helpful to
 talk about what those types have in common. Specs use these traits to
 describe groups of types that a word will accept or produce.

** Stack motion
Often you have all the data a word needs on the stack, but it's in the
wrong order. There's lots of handy words to help there.

+ üîÄ :: swap the top two items
+ üõü :: float the 3rd item up to the top
+ ‚öì :: sink the top item down to 3rd
+ flip :: reverse the top 3 items

 These words can also be combined with =ü™Ñ= and its variants to reach
 deeper into the stack.

** Cloning and dropping
When you're done with an item, you can =üóëÔ∏è= it, which eliminates it
from the top of the stack. If you know a word will consume an item you
need afterward, you can =üë•= it so you have an extra copy.
** Programs that write programs
*** Basics
The most important expressive feature of kcats is that you can
manipulate programs exactly the same way as you can any other data.

One thing you can do with a list, is treat it like a program and =‚ñ∂Ô∏è=
(execute) it. Notice that on the 5th and 6th line of the execution
trace below, the word =‚ñ∂Ô∏è= takes the list from the top of the stack on
the left, and puts its contents back on the right, making it part of
the program remaining to be run!
#+begin_src kcats
  ;;   stack  |  remaining program
  ;; ---------|--------------------
              | 4 5 6 [* +] ‚ñ∂Ô∏è inc
            4 | 5 6 [* +] ‚ñ∂Ô∏è inc
          4 5 | 6 [* +] ‚ñ∂Ô∏è inc
        4 5 6 | [* +] ‚ñ∂Ô∏è inc
  4 5 6 [* +] | ‚ñ∂Ô∏è inc
        4 5 6 | * + inc
         4 30 | + inc
           34 | inc
           35 |
#+end_src
Note that, when =* += gets moved back to the program, it went in
*front* of =inc=. 

The same way we used =üîó= to combine two lists, we can combine two
small programs into one, and then =‚ñ∂Ô∏è= it:

#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both
  4 5 6 [+] [*] üîó ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
44
#+end_src

Note that words inside lists don't perform any action when the list is
put on the stack. You can think of it as a quotation - a message being
being passed along, not acted upon.

One important theme of programming kcats is combining program snippets
in various ways, and then ‚ñ∂Ô∏è them to actually carry them out. There are
lots of program "modifiers" to help.

  {"prompt":"What is the most important expressive feature of kcats?","answer":"You can manipulate programs exactly the same way as any other data."}
  {"prompt":"True or false: In kcats programs are manipulated just like data.","answer":"True. Programs are treated as ordinary data values."}

*** Modifiers
What are modifiers? They are programs that modify other
programs.

Here's an example from everyday life: "When you're following the cake
recipe, if any ingredients are missing, go to the bake shop on Main
Street to get them. And when it calls for brown sugar, use molasses
instead". You're taking the existing instuctions (the recipe of how to
make a cake), and wrapping it in larger instructions that specify
things outside the scope of the recipe (where to get ingredients) and
also change the recipe (substitute ingredients). When you follow
instructions in everyday life, you're running a program, and we
routinely find modifiers to programs out there in written English
instructions.

Let's look at some building blocks of kcats that modify existing programs.

**** Looping and branching
***** ‚öñÔ∏è
=‚öñÔ∏è= takes 3 programs from the stack:
+ a =condition= program whose result decides which branch to take
+ the =yes= branch
+ the =no= branch

It returns a new single program that handles the condition test and
logical branching:

#+begin_src kcats 
  [126 18 mod zero?] ["divides evenly!"] ["doesn't divide!"] ‚öñÔ∏è
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[126 18 mod zero? ["divides evenly!"] ["doesn't divide!"] ‚ÜîÔ∏è]
#+end_src

The resulting program runs the actual test, which yields a boolean
value, and then calls the branching word ‚ÜîÔ∏è. That word selects which of
the two programs to run based on the test result. So what happens when
we execute that program?

#+begin_src kcats
  [126 18 mod zero? ["divides evenly!"] ["doesn't divide!"] ‚ÜîÔ∏è] ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
"divides evenly!" ‚úÖ
#+end_src

Great, so what is that checkmark? Why is that there? That's the
affirmative result from =zero?= which is still on the stack:

#+begin_src kcats 
0 zero?
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
‚úÖ
#+end_src

Our modifier ‚öñÔ∏è does not drop this result. Why keep it? Remember any
value except an empty list is affirmative, so there could have been
important data there that we'd need later. See [[Booleans][booleans]].

Let's look at one more example, where we want to test an argument and
then do something with it (in this case, add one to a number if it's
odd, or multiply it by 3 if it's even).
#+begin_src kcats
  3 [odd?] [üóëÔ∏è inc "odd, added one"] [üóëÔ∏è 3 * "even, times 3"] ‚öñÔ∏è
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[odd? [üóëÔ∏è inc "odd, added one"] [üóëÔ∏è 3 * "even, times 3"] ‚ÜîÔ∏è] 3 2 1
#+end_src

then if you run that, you get
#+begin_src kcats
  3 [odd?] [üóëÔ∏è inc "odd, added one"] [üóëÔ∏è 3 * "even, times 3"] ‚öñÔ∏è ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[[asked [consume]]
 [handled []]
 [reason "not enough items on stack"]
 [type error]
 [unwound [inc "odd, added one"]]]
#+end_src

Why didn't this work? The problem is =odd?= consumes its argument: 

#+begin_src kcats
3 odd?
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
‚úÖ
#+end_src

The original number gets lost after we check whether it's odd. We can
prevent that in several ways. One is with üë•:

#+begin_src kcats
  3 üë• odd?
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
‚úÖ 3
#+end_src

Using üë• can be a little fiddly, especially when multiple items need
to be preserved.

A more comprehensive method is to use the üõ°Ô∏è modifier. See [[Stack
effect control]] for how it works.
#+begin_src kcats
  3 [odd?] üõ°Ô∏è
  [üóëÔ∏è inc "odd, added one"]
  [ 3 * "even, times 3"] ‚öñÔ∏è ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
"odd, added one" 4
#+end_src

Finally, why do we need the üóëÔ∏è? Recall that the result of the condition
check is not automatically dropped if the result is affirmative,
because often your condition check is "is there anything to
process". In that case your condition program can just focus on trying
to get the input and not worry about checking whether there's anything
there - ‚öñÔ∏è does that for you just due to how boolean values work. 

#+begin_src kcats
  ["foo" "bar" "baz"] ;; start with a list on stack
  [üì§]  ;; results in an item from the list, or nothing if list is empty
  ["!!!" üîó] ;; add excitement to the item if there was one
  üî≥ ;; if not we're done
  ‚öñÔ∏è ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
"foo!!!" ["bar" "baz"]
#+end_src

Or if the list actually is empty:

#+begin_src kcats
  üî≥ ;; start with empty list on stack
  [üì§]  ;; results in an item, or nothing if list is empty
  ["!!!" üîó] ;; add excitement to the item if there was one
  üî≥ ;; if not we're done
  ‚öñÔ∏è ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[]
#+end_src

Notice that ‚öñÔ∏è does in fact drop the condition result *if it's
negative*. In this case the result of üì§ on an empty list is another
empty list. That 2nd empty list is dropped by the ‚öñÔ∏è logic and we're
left with just the original empty list. The reason this value is
dropped is that it's just an empty container and there's little to be
gained by examining it, we essentially already know what it was, just
as a result of reaching this code snippet.

***** ü™Ü
Recurrence (ü™Ü) is the fundamental looping construct of kcats. Every
other loop modifier is built from =ü™Ü=. 

It takes 4 arguments:
+ A predicate program
+ An body program
+ An exit  program
+ A combinator program

The result is a single recurrence program on the stack that when
executed with =‚ñ∂Ô∏è=, may place another copy of itself on the stack. For
emphasis: ü™Ü builds a program that loops, it does not execute the
program.

The recurrence program, when executed, works as follows: first the
predicate program runs (as if by =‚öñÔ∏è=). If the predicate result is
negative, the exit program runs, and then the whole program is
finished.

If the predicate result is affirmative:
  + The body program is executed
  + A copy of the original recurrence program is placed on the stack
  + The combinator is executed

In typical loop use cases, the combinator program is simply =[‚ñ∂Ô∏è]=. That
means, "execute the recurrence again". However some combinators might
do fancier things, like use =üöú=, to mean "run the recurrence program
once for each item in the list below, collect the results".

***** üåÄ
Looper (üåÄ) takes a loop body program, and returns a loop program,
which may execute the body multiple times. The loop program expects a
boolean (See [[Booleans]]) condition on the top of stack. If the condition
is negative, the body doesn't run, and the loop is finished. If it's
affirmative, the body runs, and the loop expects another boolean
condition to be on top of the stack for the next iteration.

Here's an example:

#+begin_src kcats
  1 ‚úÖ [üóëÔ∏è 2 * üë• 100 <] üåÄ ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
128
#+end_src

Notice that =üåÄ= receives the body program and builds the loop
program. The body program receives ‚úÖ (affirmative) the first
iteration. The body program sees the =‚úÖ=, and doesn't need it, so it
drops it bringing =1= to the top.  The body then multiplies by 2,
clones it and checks if it's less than 100 (note you could write =[100
<] üõ°Ô∏è= in place of =üë• 100 <=). If so, the body runs again, and so on,
until the number is not less than 100. Finally that false value is
dropped automatically and the loop is done, leaving just the final
number =128=.
***** ‚è≥
kcats also has a while loop (‚è≥), which is a bit higher level than
üåÄ. ‚è≥ is to üåÄ, as ‚öñÔ∏è is to ‚ÜîÔ∏è. Instead of expecting a boolean value on
top each time through, you provide a condition program similar to what
‚öñÔ∏è requires. ‚è≥ runs the condition program, if it leaves a affirmative
value, the loop continues, otherwise it is finished.

  {"prompt":"Yes or no: An affirmative boolean lets the üåÄ loop body execute and then asks for a new condition.","answer":"Yes."}
  {"prompt":"Why must the body of a üåÄ loop supply a new boolean after each run?","answer":"Because the loop, after executing the body on an affirmative condition, waits for another condition for the next cycle."}

  {"prompt":"True or false: The ending false value stays on the stack after a üåÄ loop finishes.","answer":"False. The loop discards the terminating false condition."}
  {"prompt":"How does üåÄ clean up the stack on loop completion?","answer":"By discarding the final negative boolean before finishing."}

** Argument order
kcats' stack-based nature can take a little getting used to, and the
reversing of the order you wrote something can be a common stumbling
block.

When writing programs like =‚öñÔ∏è=, the arguments appear in a natural order
in your code: conditional, true-branch, false-branch. However,
remember that the stack is a last-in-first-out structure - when these
items are pushed onto the stack, their order is reversed. If you
inspect the stack at this point, you'll see the false-branch on top,
followed by the true-branch, and then the conditional at the bottom.

#+begin_src kcats
  1 2 3 [üóëÔ∏è odd?] ["it's odd"] ["it's even"] ;; ‚öñÔ∏è
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
  ["it's even"] ["it's odd"] [üóëÔ∏è odd?] 3 2 1
#+end_src

This is a theme in kcats, where argument order is designed to make the
code readable - if a word takes multiple arguments, and the order
matters, the "first" logical argument is not the top of the
stack. Here's an example:

#+begin_src kcats
1 2 <
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
‚úÖ
#+end_src

When we write =1 2 <=, we mean "1 is less than 2". Even though the top
of the stack is 2, we don't consider 2 the "first" argument.

#+begin_src js :exports no
  {"prompt":"Why do written arguments appear reversed on the kcats stack?","answer":"The stack is last-in-first-out, so items pushed in code order are reversed when you view the stack."}
  {"prompt":"True or false: Arguments stay in the same order on the stack as they are written in kcats code.","answer":"False. LIFO semantics reverse their order."}
  {"prompt":"How does kcats' LIFO nature affect argument order?","answer":"Each new argument is pushed on top, so the written sequence ends up inverted on the stack."}
  {"prompt":"What order do ‚öñÔ∏è arguments occupy on the stack after pushing them?","answer":"Top: false-branch, then true-branch, bottom: conditional."}
  {"prompt":"True or false: The conditional for ‚öñÔ∏è sits at the top of the stack when ready to run.","answer":"False. It rests at the bottom; the false-branch is on top."}
  {"prompt":"Which piece is stacked directly above the true branch when preparing ‚öñÔ∏è?","answer":"The false-branch program, because the push order is reversed."}
  {"prompt":"Why isn‚Äôt the top value considered the first logical argument in kcats?","answer":"kcats orders code for readability; the logical first argument is pushed first and ends up deeper in the stack."}
  {"prompt":"Yes or no: The top-of-stack is always the first logical argument in kcats.","answer":"No. Argument order is inverted to keep source code natural to read."}
  {"prompt":"How does kcats keep code readable despite reversed stack order?","answer":"By letting programmers list arguments in natural order while the runtime silently reverses them on the stack."}

#+end_src
** Item hiding
Sometimes you have a program that you don't trust with a certain stack
item. Perhaps there's a password on the stack, and you're running an
untrusted program given to you by someone else.

What if there was a way to hide that password behind your back such
that the program never even knew it was there, and then restore it
after the untrusted program was finished?

=ü™Ñ= takes an item on the top of the stack, and a program. It
temporarily makes the item disappear, and runs the program. After the
program is done, the item reappears on top of the stack.

#+begin_src kcats
  1 2 "mypassword" [+] ü™Ñ
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
"mypassword" 3
#+end_src

Notice the addition program could not access the password even if it
tried. It isn't on the stack while it's executing, it's hidden away
elsewhere in the runtime, temporarily.

To demonstrate we can use the word üì∏, which takes a snapshot of the
entire stack and places it on top of the stack.

#+begin_src kcats
"foo" "bar" "hidden!" [üì∏] ü™Ñ 
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
"hidden!" ["bar" "foo"] "bar" "foo"
#+end_src

So here we see the snapshot =["bar" "foo"]=, the word ="hidden"= nowhere
to be found. That's because when the snapshot was taken, it was hidden
away and wasn't anywhere on the stack. Then ="hidden"= is placed back on
top after the snapshot is done.

=ü™Ñ= is very common in kcats, and it's used mostly in cases where you
don't actually care if a program reads an item, you just want the
item out of the way temporarily, and it's easier than finicky
swapping. However in cases where there is a trust issue, no amount of
swapping can fix the problem; you definitely should reach for =ü™Ñ=.

#+begin_src js :exports no
  {"prompt":"What does ü™Ñ do with the top stack item and a program?","answer":"It hides the top item, executes the given program, then restores the item to the top of the stack."}
  {"prompt":"True or false: ü™Ñ hides the top item, runs a program, then puts the item back.","answer":"True."}
  {"prompt":"How does ü™Ñ execute a program while preserving the top item?","answer":"It temporarily removes the item, runs the program, and reinstates the item afterward."}
  {"prompt":"Is the hidden item on the stack while the ü™Ñ program runs?","answer":"No. During execution the item is completely absent, so the program cannot access it."}
  {"prompt":"True or false: A program executed inside ü™Ñ can still read the hidden item.","answer":"False. The item is removed from the stack until the program finishes."}
  {"prompt":"Why can't an untrusted program see a password hidden by ü™Ñ?","answer":"Because ü™Ñ removes the password from the stack, making it inaccessible during the program's run."}
  {"prompt":"When do kcats programmers commonly use ü™Ñ?","answer":"Whenever they need to hide or temporarily move an item, especially with untrusted code or to avoid complex swaps."}
  {"prompt":"True or false: ü™Ñ is preferred over swapping for temporarily clearing space on the stack.","answer":"True‚Äîit is simpler and also protects sensitive data."}
  {"prompt":"Why choose ü™Ñ instead of swapping when dealing with untrusted code?","answer":"Swapping leaves the item visible; ü™Ñ actually hides it, preventing the code from ever seeing it."}
#+end_src
** Stack effect control
kcats provides some facilities to let you avoid tedious cloning of
items to keep from losing them. Most words consume items from the
stack to produce new items. Sometimes you'll still need those old
items again later.

Let's say you want to check if two items are equal, and if not, add them to a list.

Naively you might try this:

#+begin_src kcats
  [] 5 6 [=] [] [[üìÆ] ü™Ñ üìÆ] ‚öñÔ∏è ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[[asked [consume]]
 [handled üî≥]
 [reason "not enough items on stack"]
 [trace [ü™Ñ]]
 [type error]
 [unwound [üìÆ üî≥ üìÆ]]]
#+end_src

The problem is that === consumes both the numbers, just leaving a
boolean. What if we could specify that the program =[=]= isn't allowed
to permanently consume any stack items, it's just allowed produce a
result?

That's what üõ°Ô∏è does.

#+begin_src kcats
  5 6 [=] üõ°Ô∏è ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
üî≥ 6 5
#+end_src

So we can just drop üõ°Ô∏è into the original program right after the
program we want to modify, and that should fix things:

#+begin_src kcats
  [] 5 6 [=] üõ°Ô∏è [] [[üìÆ] ü™Ñ üìÆ] ‚öñÔ∏è ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

  {"prompt":"Which position applies the üõ°Ô∏è shield to code?","answer":"Directly following the code segment; the shield token comes after the program."}

** Down stack variants
There are words like =‚Ä¢ü™Ñ=, =‚Ä¢üõ°Ô∏è=, =‚Ä¢üîÄ=, =‚Ä¢üóëÔ∏è=, =‚Ä¢üêã=. What are those?

It's a modification of the original where the effect is one stack
element further down from the original. Each dot represents a stack
item that is above where the word has its effect (or where the word
ends its effect). What exactly is further down, depends on the word.

+ ‚Ä¢üîÄ :: swap the 2nd and 3rd stack items (instead of 1st and 2nd).
+ ‚Ä¢ü™Ñ :: hide the top two stack items (instead of just the 1st).
+ ‚Ä¢üõ°Ô∏è :: Protect all but the top stack item (instead of the whole stack).
+ ‚Ä¢üóëÔ∏è :: drops the 2nd item (instead of the top item)
+ ‚Ä¢üêã :: Skips over top 2 stack items and returns result to top (instead of skipping only top item)
+ ‚Ä¢üìÆ :: Puts the top item into the 3rd item
  
Similarly the =deep= variants are one level even deeper than that:

+ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢üîÄ :: swap the 3rd and 4th items
+ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ü™Ñ :: hide the top 3 items
+ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢üõ°Ô∏è :: protect all but the top two items
+ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢üóëÔ∏è :: drops the 3rd item
+ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢üìÆ :: Puts the top item into the 4th item

** Templating and destructuring
Templating and destructuring are two opposite operations. Templating
takes a strucutred template that contains placeholders, and some
values, and puts the values in the correct place in the
template. Conversely, matching takes a filled-in structure, and a
pattern containing placeholders, and extracts values back out from the
filled-in structure according to the pattern.
*** Templating with üéí
Let's take a look at a simple example:

#+begin_src kcats
  "foo" "bar" "baz"
  [[a 1Ô∏è‚É£]
   [b 2Ô∏è‚É£]
   [z 3Ô∏è‚É£]]
  üéí 
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[[a "baz"]
 [b "bar"]
 [z "foo"]]
#+end_src

Notice that the numbered placeholders 1Ô∏è‚É£ 2Ô∏è‚É£ etc refer to places on the
stack: 1Ô∏è‚É£ is the top, 2Ô∏è‚É£ is the 2nd stack item etc.  üéí takes values
from the stack and inserts them into the template.
*** Destructuring directly to stack with #Ô∏è‚É£‚õèÔ∏è
Again, let's look at a simple example, that calculates the total cost
of an inventory of smartphones.

#+begin_src kcats
  [[smartphone [[pricing [[quantity 2]

  #Ô∏è‚É£‚õèÔ∏è * * 
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
209.7
#+end_src

Notice that here we're doing the opposite of üéí - extracting values
back out of the filed in structure and putting them on the stack. We
mark the items to be extracted using numbered markers, that correspond
to places on the stack.

But why do we need to call =assocify= here? Answer: If we don't, then
kcats does list matching, where order matters. What happens if we
forget =assocify=?

#+begin_src kcats

#+end_src

Here we see a mismatch because in the =pricing= association, in the data
=quantity= is first, but in the pattern, =price= is first. The error
message is telling us what specifically didn't match.

Wildcards are supported inside lists. Use the word =_= to indicate that
any value should match at that position:

#+begin_src kcats
  [a 12 "foo" "mydata" 13]
  [a _ _ 1Ô∏è‚É£ 13]
  #Ô∏è‚É£‚õèÔ∏è
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
"mydata"
#+end_src

Wildcards aren't used in associations - if you want to match "any
value" for an association key, just leave it out of the
pattern. Matching "any key" for a given value, is not supported.
*** Destructuring to an association
If you want to destructure a bunch of values, or just don't want to
put multiple values onto the stack, you can also destructure into an
association. Instead of numbered placeholders, you'll use names. But
in order to differentiate between placeholders and other words, you'll
need to prefix the word with the tag character =üè∑Ô∏è=, and use the word =üè∑Ô∏è‚õèÔ∏è=
to execute the destructuring.

One unusual and important feature of kcats is that you can program the
runtime. What does that mean? It means you can control exactly *how* a
program is executed.

Why would you want to do that? Well, one common use case is that you
want to debug the program: you'd like to manually control execution
while you examine the state of the program, to figure out where it's
going wrong.

Another use case is security: you want to execute a program but not
allow it to access things that programs normally can access (like the
filesystem or network). You also don't want the program to be able to
permanently redefine what words mean.

So how exactly do we alter how programs are executed? A kcats program
keep track of 3 things as it is running, its state: the *stack* (the
data the program is working with), the *program* (the remaining
instructions left to be executed), and the *dictionary* (the words that
have meaning in a program). We call the whole state an *environment*,
and we can create and work with environments in kcats just like any
other data, including executing the progams within them.
*** Environments
First let's look at how to create an environment:
#+begin_src kcats
[[program [1 2 +]]] environment
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[[dictionary [[modules [#b64 "core"]]
              [words 274_entries]]]
 [program [1 2 +]]
 [stack üî≥]]
#+end_src

Notice how `environment` takes an association and fills out the
`dictionary` and `stack`. Why does it say `270_entries`?
Normally dictionaries would be printed out in their entirety, just
like any other data, but because they're large (there are hundreds of
words) by default the runtime prints it as the count of the words.

So this is an environment. What words are useful here? Well, first of
all we can treat it as an association, which it is. Here we replace
the last item in the program so we're subtracting instead of adding.

#+begin_src kcats
  [[program [1 2 +]]] environment
  [program] [pop üóëÔ∏è [-] üîó] update
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[[dictionary [[modules [#b64 "core"]]
              [words 274_entries]]]
 [program [1 2 -]]
 [stack üî≥]]
#+end_src

Ok, well, this is not that exciting, if =environment= is just another
kind of association right? Point taken, but now let's use the word
`eval-step`:

#+begin_src kcats
  [[program [1 2 +]]] environment
  eval-step
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[[dictionary [[modules [#b64 "core"]]
              [words 274_entries]]]
 [program [2 +]]
 [stack [1]]]
#+end_src

That evaluates the environment one step! We can do two more steps to finish the program:

#+begin_src kcats
  [[program [1 2 +]]] environment
  [eval-step] 3 times ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[[dictionary [[modules [#b64 "core"]]
              [words 274_entries]]]
 [program üî≥]
 [stack [3]]]
#+end_src
*** Debugging
**** The debugger
In kcats, we don't need an external debugger. We can debug our
programs right in the kcats interpeter. We can specify the program to
run and step through it.

Let's say this is the program we want to step through. This is how
we'd normally run it:
#+begin_src kcats :exports both :results code
  0 1 3 inc 1 range [+] ü™ú ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
6
#+end_src

To debug, we put it into an environment item which we can then use
debugging words like =advance=:

#+begin_src kcats :exports both :results code
  [[program [0 1 3 inc 1 range [+] ü™ú ‚ñ∂Ô∏è]]] environment
  [advance] 8 times ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
  eval-step
  [advance] 2 times ‚ñ∂Ô∏è eval-step eval-step
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[[dictionary [[modules [#b64 "core"]]
              [words 274_entries]]]
 [program [üîÄ [+] üë• ‚Ä¢ü™Ñ ü™ú ‚ñ∂Ô∏è]]
 [stack [1 [2 3]
         0]]]
#+end_src

Note that =advance= is like =step-over= in a traditional debugger, and
=eval-step= is like =step-into=.  So above we advance until we reach the
word =step= in the program, and then we step into it. We end up showing
the environment in the middle of execution. The stack has a program
=[+]= on top, and the next word is =execute= which will run that program.

You can also use a =until= loop to run the program until an arbitrary
condition is hit. Here's one that runs the program until the number ==2=
is on the top of stack (note the handy word =tos= shortcut)

#+begin_src kcats
  [0 1 3 inc 1 range [+] ü™ú ‚ñ∂Ô∏è] stage
  [tos 2 =] üõ°Ô∏è [üóëÔ∏è eval-step] until ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[[dictionary [[modules [#b64 "core"]]
              [words 274_entries]]]
 [program [üîÄ [+] üë• ‚Ä¢ü™Ñ ü™ú ‚ñ∂Ô∏è]]
 [stack [2 [3] 1]]]
#+end_src

You can do whatever you want with the environment data - you can
retain the environment at every step, filter the steps, change them,
and continue the execution from any arbitrary place.

It's particularly handy to save an environment at the "last known
good" state and continue from there, instead of having to re-execute
from the beginning each time.

Just as an example of what's possible, here we show only the states
where =+= is about to be executed. =stepper generator= takes an
environment and generates all the steps of execution. Note =top= means
"top of program", so it's keeping the states where =+= is the next item
in the program. We drop the dictionary from each one, because we don't
need it and in this case it's always the same.
#+begin_src kcats
  [0 1 3 inc 1 range [+] ü™ú ‚ñ∂Ô∏è] stage 
  stepper generator
  
  [top üéÅ [+]  = ] keep
  ;[[dictionary] unassign] each
  collect 
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
üî≥ üî≥
#+end_src

Then just to show that all these environments work on their own, we'll
add some code to select the first one and step it forward. So we've
essentially gone back in time and rolled forward again.
#+begin_src kcats
  [0 1 3 inc 1 range [+] ü™ú ‚ñ∂Ô∏è] stage 
  stepper generator
  [top üéÅ [+] =] keep
  collect
  first eval-step
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[[dictionary [[lingo 270_entries]
              [modules [#b64 "core"]]
              [words 270_entries]]]
 [program [[2 3]
           [+] ü™ú ‚ñ∂Ô∏è]]
 [stack [1]]]
üî≥
#+end_src

We can even mess with the stack and the program:
#+begin_src kcats
  [0 1 3 inc 1 range [+] ü™ú ‚ñ∂Ô∏è] stage 
  stepper generator
  [top üéÅ [+] =] keep
  collect

  ;; add this
  first ;; to select the first env from above
  [program 0] [-] üç´ assign ;; change + to - right before it is run

  ;; now step forward again
  eval-step
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[[dictionary [[lingo 265_entries]
              [modules [#b64 "core"]]
              [words 265_entries]]]
 [program [[2 3] [+] ü™ú ‚ñ∂Ô∏è]]
 [stack [-1]]]
üî≥
#+end_src

**** Other tools
The "good old fashioned" method of debugging a program is to put =print=
statements throughout the program to get insight into what's
happening.

You can do that in kcats too!

#+begin_src kcats
  3 [odd?] üõ°Ô∏è [üóëÔ∏è "it was odd" print inc] ["it was even" print 2 *] ‚öñÔ∏è ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
it was odd
4
#+end_src

=print= takes a string and will print it to standard out.

There's also a way to print the current stack, it's called =dump=, and
it has has no stack effect, so it's safe to put anywhere.

#+begin_src kcats
  1 2 3 [odd?] üõ°Ô∏è [üóëÔ∏è dump inc] [dump 2 *] ‚öñÔ∏è ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

#+end_src
** Error handling
In kcats, when a program encounters an error, two things happen: (1)
an error item describing the problem is placed on the stack, and (2)
the remaining program operations that haven't executed yet are
"unwound" (collected into the error's =unwound= field rather than being
executed). This allows programs to both examine what went wrong and
potentially resume execution using the saved operations.

#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both
2 3 "four" * + 
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[[actual "four"]
 [asked [number?]]
 [handled üî≥]
 [reason "type mismatch"]
 [type error]
 [unwound [* +]]]
"four" 3 2
#+end_src

Notice the =unwound= field contains the rest of the program that
remained when the error occurred.

We can fix the problem and continue, but only if we can stop the
unwinding before our entire program is unwound. We can do that using
the word =ü©π=, which creates a self-recovering program. It takes two component
programs: =p= and =r=. =p= is run and if it results in an error, the
unwinding is limited to =p= and then =r= is run. When =r= runs, the error
item is on the top of stack. If there is no error, =r= does not run.

In the program below, we recover by discarding the error and the
string "four", and replacing it with the number =4=. Then trying the
operations =* += again.
#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both
  2 3 "four" [* +] [üóëÔ∏è üóëÔ∏è 4 * +] ü©π ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
14
#+end_src

The problem with the usage of =ü©π= above is that we had to specify
the arithmetic words =* += twice - once in =p= and again in =r= in case they
failed the first time. Remember those operations are saved in the
=unwound= field of the error, and we can access them and even =‚ñ∂Ô∏è=
them. There is a word that does this for you: =retry=: it takes an error
on the top of stack, and executes its =unwound= program.

#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both
  2 3 "four" [* +] [[üóëÔ∏è 4] ü™Ñ retry] ü©π ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
14
#+end_src

In the above program, after the error occurs, we discard the string
underneath the error and replace it with the integer =4=.

Sometimes you need to raise your own errors, you can do that with the
word =fail=.

#+begin_src kcats
  2
  [odd?]
  ["ok"]
  [[[type error] [asked odd?] [reason "expected odd number"]]
   association fail]
  ‚öñÔ∏è ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

[[asked odd?]
 [handled üî≥]
 [reason "expected odd number"]
 [trace [fail ‚ñ∂Ô∏è]]
 [type error]
 [unwound [3 4 +]]]
#+end_src

Sometimes you want to handle some errors but not others. There's no
error type matching like you'd find with java's =catch=. You have to
recover, examine the error, and if it's one you don't want to handle,
re-activate it with =fail=.

  {"prompt":"How does ü©π provide self-recovery in kcats?","answer":"It confines unwinding to p and then lets r run, enabling custom recovery using the error item."}
  {"prompt":"What inconvenience can arise when using ü©π for retries?","answer":"You may have to duplicate some of the original operations from p inside r, to run them after fixing the error."}
  {"prompt":"True or false: Using ü©π can force you to duplicate code inside the recovery block.","answer":"True. You often need to repeat the original operations in r."}
  {"prompt":"Why might ü©π lead to duplicate code?","answer":"Because r must contain the same steps as p if you plan to re-execute them after recovery."}

** Your own words
You're not stuck with just the vocabulary in the starting
environment. You can add your own vocabulary!
*** Concepts
One hard rule of kcats: "an environment cannot change its own
dictionary". 

What does this mean for being able to define new behavior? If we can't
alter the current dictionary to add or modify words, what can we do?
Answer: you can run your program inside another environment, with a
different dictionary.

This has some important security benefits that most languages do not have.

+ There are no global redefinition attacks that communities like
  Javascript and Python have suffered through many times. (Where a
  compromised library replaces a common function with an attack
  payload, and the user's own code trips over it later when calling
  the common function)

+ It's possible to completely disable further modifications, for use
  cases where security takes precedence over expressivity. This is not
  possible in other dynamic languages.

Let's look at how kcats accomplishes this. The word =dictionary=
retrieves the current dictionary and places it on the stack. Then we
can treat it like any other data and alter it. Then we can create a
new environment and =evaluate= that environment, and retrieve its stack.

Doing this with low level constructs looks like this:
#+begin_src kcats
   ;; Fetch the current dictionary
   dictionary
   ;; Create a new set of words
   [[square [üë• *]]] draft
   ;; apply the change to the dictionary
   [words] üîÄ update
   ;; The program to run with the new dictionary
   [9 square]
   ;; Create an environment and evaluate it
   [program dictionary] label
   environment evaluate
   ;; make the inner stack the new stack
   [stack] üîç restore
   ;; note the current dictionary is not altered
   dictionary [words square] üîç
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
üî≥ 81
#+end_src

Obviously this is quite cumbersome, so there are higher level words to
do all of this for you, like =let=.
*** New Words
The most straightforward and common change you can make to the
dictionary, is to add a word that wasn't in there before, and use it
in some limited scope after which it is no longer accessible.

The word =let= is handy for small bits of code where you don't want to
repeat yourself:

#+begin_src kcats
  [[square [üë• *]]]
  [9 square 8 square +]
  let ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
145
#+end_src

Let's break this down. The word =let= takes two arguments, a list of new
words paired with their definitions, and a program to run that uses
those words. We define a new word =square= to mean =[üë• *]=, and then
we create a program that runs =[9 square 8 square +]= inside an
environment with the new word =square= defined. Then finally execute
that program to get =145=.

The list of new words can even refer to another word from the same list:

#+begin_src kcats
  [[square [üë• *]]
   [fourth [square square]]]
  [3 fourth]
  let ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
81
#+end_src

Words you're defining can refer to themselves - recursive functions
are great! 

#+begin_src kcats
  [[factorial [[üîÄ positive?] üõ°Ô∏è
               [üóëÔ∏è [*] ‚Ä¢üõ°Ô∏è ‚ñ∂Ô∏è [dec] ü™Ñ factorial]
               when ‚ñ∂Ô∏è]]]
  [9 1 factorial ‚Ä¢üóëÔ∏è]
  let ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
362880
#+end_src
*** Altering meanings of existing words
Creating new words is relatively safe - presumably no one is using
those words, so giving them meaning doesn't cause any confusion. It's
when you start changing an existing meaning that things get a bit
complicated.

As we have seen, words perform actions, and those actions are
specified by other words. So a word =foo= can use the word =bar= as part
of its execution. So let's say I change the meaning of the word
=bar=. Does that mean I changed the meaning of =foo= as well (because =bar=
is part of the meaning of =foo=)?

The answer is it depends.

In kcats, by default, the answer is *no*. When you are changing the
meaning, it's for you own immediate use of the word. Let's go over
some examples.

Let's say we want to alter the meaning of a rather important word
that's used all over the place in the standard library: =üóëÔ∏è=. "When I
say =üóëÔ∏è= I want to just insert the number 5."

#+begin_src kcats
  [[üóëÔ∏è [5]]]
  ["a" "b" "c" üóëÔ∏è]
  let ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
5 "c" "b" "a"
#+end_src

Ok, straightforward enough, right? But what happens if we call another
word that uses =üóëÔ∏è=, like =times=? First let's look at the definition of
=times=, to see that it really does call =üóëÔ∏è=:

#+begin_src kcats
[times] definition
#+end_src

It calls =swap= quite a bit! Now let's alter the meaning of =swap= and call =times=.

#+begin_src kcats

#+end_src

Notice that =times= still works as expected! Even though it calls =swap=
internally, it didn't insert any =5='s. Only our own =swap= did that.

You can even refer to the old behavior of a word when defining new behavior:

#+begin_src kcats
  [[swap [5 swap]]]
  [["hi"] 3 times swap]
  let 
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
"hi" 5 "hi" "hi"
#+end_src

Here we redefine =swap= to mean "insert 5, and then do whatever swap did
before". This works even though =swap= is an axiom word:
#+begin_src kcats
  [swap] definition
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
builtin
#+end_src

There are two other words related to =let= that are more flexible for
times when you need to do a bit more complex alterations of existing
meaning. One of the primary use cases is adding a method. You've got a
word that behaves differently depending on its argument and you want
to add a new behavior.

#+begin_src kcats
  [[hash [[type [foo] üç´ =]
          [drop "foo" hash]
          addmethod]]]
  [[[foo myfoo]] association hash] revise
  "foo" hash =
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
yes
#+end_src

What have we done here? We're taking the word hash, which is just a =decide=:

#+begin_src kcats
[first] definition
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[üì§ ‚Ä¢üóëÔ∏è]
#+end_src

See how it behaves differently for a byte array by calling =hashbytes=
and by default it calls =encode= and then tries =hash= again? So now we've
added a new logic branch there:

#+begin_src kcats
  [[hash [[type [foo] üç´ =]
          [drop "foo" hash]
          addmethod]]]
  [[hash] definition] revise
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[[[[type [foo] üç´ =] [drop "foo" hash]]
  [[bytes?] [hashbytes]]
  [[yes] [encode hash]]]
 decide]
#+end_src

When the type is 'foo', we use the hash of the string "foo".
*** Sharing code
**** Overview
Sometimes you want to add some vocabulary to your environment that
someone else wrote. We call those =modules=. A module makes some changes
to the standard dictionary, usually by adding new words (as you saw
already with =let=). The difference with a module is that a set of
changes are bound up together and given an =alias=. You can load a
module and then use it by using some words in it, we'll see how in a
bit.

**** Contents
The contents of a module is a program whose input will be the current
environment's dictionary, and it should output a new, modified
dictionary. Typically, the module will add some new words to the
dictionary, but it can also alter or delete them. Here's some example modules:

This one adds two words, =square= and =cube= - it gives two definitions in
a list and =join= s them with the existing dictionary, merging them
together.
#+begin_src kcats
  [[square [[definition [üë• *]]]]
   [cube [[definition [üë• square *]]]]]
  join
#+end_src

This one changes the definition of an existing word: it adds the
action =‚Ä¢üóëÔ∏è= to the end of the definition of the word =foo=.
#+begin_src kcats
  [foo definition] [[‚Ä¢üóëÔ∏è] join] update
#+end_src

**** Inscribing a module vs using a module
When you =inscribe= a module, you make it available to be used, but the
module's changes remain invisible until called upon with =using=.

#+begin_src kcats
  ;; inscribe a new module that we explicitly pass in
  [mymodule] üç´
  [[[plus2 [[definition [2 +]]]]] join] inscribe
  ;; leaves the hash on the stack but let's drop it and pretend we want
  ;; to use the module later
  drop
  ;; If we try to use plus2 it won't work yet:
  ;; 
  ;; 3 plus2
  ;; 
  ;; we have to declare we're using mymodule:
  [mymodule] [3 plus2] using
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
5
#+end_src

=using= takes a list of modules so you can use more than one at a
time. It only applies to the given program.

**** Quick and dirty words with let
Sometimes you want to define some words and use them right away and
not care about making a module for use elsewhere. There's a word that
combines =inscribe= and =using= for you, it's called =let=:

#+begin_src kcats
  [[plus2 [2 +]]]
  [3 plus2] let
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
5
#+end_src

However there are some downsides to using =let=. You should not call =let=
in a tight loop, because each time it's called it's going to re-define
the module, which is a relatively expensive operation. Instead you
should call =inscribe= outside the loop, and use =resolve=. The difference
between =using= and =resolve= becomes clear when we look at how =using= is
defined:
#+begin_src kcats
dictionary [using definition] üîç
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[resolve execute]
#+end_src

=using= modifies a program by resolving all words to their modules, and
then executes the program. If you intend to use a module's words in a
tight loop, you can =resolve= the program and then later pass that
program to the looping construct:

#+begin_src kcats
  [mymodule] üç´ [[plus2 [2 +]]] draft inscribe drop
  1 10 1 range 
#+end_src

[[definition [2 +]]] [plus2] dictionary_redacted #b64 "M4G/6zwsAHWojAeJtU/Zrg/qYfE2QrnF3l5Bh9pqja4="
#+end_src

**** Aliases
Modules are identified by their cryptographic hash [fn:4]. That lets
you be sure that the code you meant to run, is actually what you are
running. However since hashes look like this
=/1vRbfFezlcTCUfQCjC1FKukWLoOAeBuvxNXUDbFKSk==, kcats can keep track of
human-readable module nicknames for you, and they're called
=aliases=. For example you might call
=/1vRbfFezlcTCUfQCjC1FKukWLoOAeBuvxNXUDbFKSk== by the name =customers=.

When you refer to a module, you can refer to it either by its hash or
its alias. Aliases are not universal names, they're local to your
program. So you can use whatever aliases you want, without worrying
about them colliding with other people's aliases. 
 
[fn:4] A cryptographic hash is a function that converts an arbitrary
block of data into a fixed-size string of bytes. The function is
designed to make it computationally infeasible to find an input that
gives a particular output. This property, along with the fact that
even a small change in the original data produces a significantly
different hash, makes cryptographic hashes essential for content
integrity checks. By comparing the computed hash of the content at two
points in time, one can verify that the content has not been altered,
providing a simple yet powerful tool for ensuring data integrity and
security.
**** Security rules
There are some safeguards in place to ensure that words mean what you
expect them to mean, and that modules you load can't change the
meaning of words outside of where you intended.

+ Aliases are immutable for the lifetime of your program - once you
  alias a name to hash, you cannot change it. You can only create new
  aliases. Trying to modify an alias to a new hash, is an error.
+ You cannot alter words in the core dictionary (the words of the
  default environment before any modules are loaded).
+ You cannot truly delete words either, you can only shadow them. If
  you delete a word from the dictionary in a module definition, what
  happens is the runtime makes a copy of that word, whose definition
  is to return the same error as if the word isn't defined. This
  allows you to block a program from accessing some words, but it is
  not a global or permanent change.
** Generators
*** Overview
Sometimes in programming, having the concept of an indefinite sequence
is handy. You have part of your program producing data, and another
consuming it, but the producer doesn't know how much the consumer will
actually need. A producer might calculate a huge number of items at
great expense, only for the consumer to only need a tiny fraction of
them. Generators allow the consumer to tell the producer when to
produce, but the producer still retains all the logic of how that's done.

In kcats there's no special sauce for generators, we can implement
them as a pattern with just the standard words we've already seen.
*** Example
Let's say you want to create the fibonacci sequence. Let's see how we
can code that without worrying about how many items in the sequence
we'll eventually need.

A generator consists of two things: state, and a program. Each time
we want to generate an item, we run the program. The program should
produce a new item and update the state. We just put however many
state items we need on the stack, and then a program that can work
with those items.

#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both
  1 0 [[+] ‚Ä¢üõ°Ô∏è ‚ñ∂Ô∏è üîÄ üë•]
#+end_src

So here we start with =1 0=. That's the starting state. Normally we'd
start fibonacci with =1 1= but this isn't the actual first two numbers
in the sequence, it's starting values we use to calculate them. Then
we have a program that takes two numbers as input and leaves one new
number. Let's just =‚ñ∂Ô∏è= that program and see the result:

#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both
  1 0 [[+] ‚Ä¢üõ°Ô∏è ‚ñ∂Ô∏è üîÄ üë•] ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
1 1 1
#+end_src

We can see the =0= is now =1= and there's an extra =1= on the
stack. Remember the generator must do two things, produce a new item
and update the state. It updated the state from =0 1= to =1 1=, and
produced the first item, =1=.

This gets us one number, but not the whole fibonacci sequence. Let's
look at the word =generator=. It creates a recurrence - a program that
when you run it, may leave another copy of itself on the stack ready
to be run again.

You can ‚ñ∂Ô∏è this recurrence and get the next item in the fibonacci
sequence, and beneath that you get another copy of it ready to be run
again, when you've done what you need to with the first item it gave
you.

#+end_src

Notice here that the only
difference from before is that the program is sandwiched between the
fibonacci number we produced, and the state.

Let's keep going and execute again! But wait, before we do that
we need to do something with item we just produced, to get it out of
the way. For now we'll just =üóëÔ∏è= it. We've seen it and we want to
see what's next.

#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both

#+end_src

Ok, so the 2nd item is =1= and we can see the state is updated -
instead of =1 1= we have =1 2=.

One more time:
#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both
  1 0 [[+] ‚Ä¢üõ°Ô∏è ‚ñ∂Ô∏è üîÄ üë•] generator ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

#+end_src

Ok we can see that we can get items one at a time by calling
=generate=, but this is not very useful. What we really want is to get
the first =20= numbers in the fibonacci sequence, and collect them into a
list. We can do exactly that:

#+begin_src kcats
  1 0 [[+] ‚Ä¢üõ°Ô∏è ‚ñ∂Ô∏è üîÄ üë•] generator
  20 taker
  collect
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

6765 10946
#+end_src

There's the fibonacci sequence! And the state is still there beneath
in case we want to use it again.

So what is happening here? We're building up generators by wrapping
one in another. Starting with the last, we have =collect= which will
repeatedly call =‚ñ∂Ô∏è= generator inside it. It keeps going and collecting
the generated items in a list, until the inner generator returns
=üî≥=. Then it stops and returns what it collected.

Then inside =collect= we have a generator =20 taker= - what that does is
keeps its own state of how many items we want it to take. It counts
down as it generates items inside it, passing them up to =collect= and
when it hits zero, it returns =üî≥= (even if the generator below it
would have produced something, =taker= won't even ask). That will signal
=collect= to stop.

We have other handy generators we can stack up. Let's say for whatever
reason we want to know what are the first 20 *odd* fibonacci numbers?
Well, we have =keep=:

#+begin_src kcats
  1 0 [[+] ‚Ä¢üõ°Ô∏è ‚ñ∂Ô∏è üîÄ üë•] generator ;; our original generator
  [odd?] keep ;; a generator that keeps calling the one

              ;; passes the predicate we specified
  20 taker ;; another generator that calls generate 20 times

#+end_src

There we have it. We can see that =[2 2 2]= is what makes up =8=, etc.

Other included generators are:

+ dropper :: Inverse of =taker= - drops the first n items of the
  sequence and returns the rest.
+ joiner :: Joins items together
+ integers :: all the numbers starting with 0

=reduce= will consume what a generator produces. You provide a program
that takes 2 arguments, and =reduce= will generate all the items, and
pass to your program: the result so far and the next item generated,
and repeat that until there are no items left:

#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both

*** Compatibility
Let's say you go to the trouble of making a beautiful stack of
transformations and you want to re-use it, but you don't have a
generator, you have a list! Our transformation stack needs a
*generator*! How are we supposed to use it?  Never fear, there is a
simple way to adapt transformations to work on anything that works
with the word =take=. You can use the word =liberator= to adapt a list to
a generator.

*** Capturing items from the stack
One pitfall with generators is that sometimes you want to transform
generated items and use some item from the stack to help do it. The
problem with this is that generators can be arbitrarily deep and you
won't know exactly how deep that item is.

The solution is to =capture= the items you want.

Let's look at a simple example. Let's say we want to generate every
multiple of n (where n is some number on the stack). We can already
generate every integer, we just need to multiply each one by n. A naive
solution would be to just use =each=, but it doesn't work:

#+begin_src kcats
   3 integers generator
   10 taker
   [*] each
   ;1 dropper ;; drop 0
   ;10 taker
   collect
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[0 8 14 18 20 20 18 14 8 0]
9 3
#+end_src

This doesn't work because n and the last integer we generated aren't
next to each other on the stack, there's a bunch of generator
machinery in between. We could try to guess exactly how deep the
machinery is, but then our generators aren't composable anymore - we
couldn't move that call to =each= somewhere else in the generator stack,
without having to change the program. What we really should do is
create our program for =each= first, before we start stacking up
generators, and =bind= n:

#+begin_src kcats
  3 
  [*] bind
  [integers] dip ;; insert the integers generator below the each program
  each
  1 dropper
  10 taker collect
#+end_src

                                                while [generate swap]
                                                dip float]

0 [generate [[3 *]
             bail]
   shielddown]
[inc üë•]
10
#+end_src

What exactly is this doing? We're taking values from the current
stack, and prepending them to a program, so that later when the
program executes, it'll find that value on the top of the stack. Put
another way, we're *binding* the value of the first argument to the
program now, rather than letting it take a value from the top of the
stack later.
** Coordination and Input/Output
*** Basics
In kcats, both coordination and input/output are done with =pipes=. See
the [[Key terminology][definition]] for pipe.

Let's take a common example of coordination. Your program has to do
several very long and intensive calculations but doesn't want to make
the user wait to do other things. The way that's done in kcats is by
creating multiple environments, and have them communicate with each
other using pipes. You can send any item through a pipe that you could
put onto the stack, including other pipes. You can =üë•= a pipe, and give
one copy to another environment, so that there are two ends to the
same pipe.

Pipes support two main operations: putting an item in (=üìÆ=), or taking
an item out (=üì§=). Either one of those operations may *block*, if the
pipe is either full (when putting) or empty (when taking). Your
environment would have to wait for the other end of the pipe to take
something out so there's space to put a new item in, or put something
in so that there's something to take out.

All pipes share the =üìÆ= and =üì§= operations, but they can differ in other
ways.

Note that lists support pipe operations: =üìÆ= adds an item to the end,
and =üì§= removes the first item. Neither will ever block when used on a
list. A slight difference is what happens when you've reached the end
of the content (either the list is empty or the pipe has, for example,
hit the end of file condition): a =üì§= from an empty list will just
return =üî≥=, but a =üì§= from a file pipe that is at EOF will result in an
error. The use of errors in that case, is to differentiate between
"there's temporarily nothing there" vs "there will never be any more
items". With lists only one of those can happen, so we can use üî≥ to
signal that. But IO pipes like files and network sockets have
additional states. 

*** Input/output
Let's look at how we do I/O using files as an example - let's say we
want to write the word =foo= to a file called =bar=:

#+begin_src kcats :results code  :exports both
  [[file "bar"]] pipe-in ;; create the pipe to the given file "foo"
  "foo" encode ;; we have to convert string to bytes first, using the word
              ;; =encode=.
  üìÆ ;; finally, put the bytes into the pipe, and they are written to
     ;; the file
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
[[endpoint [[file "bar"]]]
 [in bytes]
 [out bytes]
 [type pipe]]
#+end_src

Note the representation of the pipe shows where it leads (the =endpoint=
field), and what types of items it can carry (the =in= and =out= field).

Neither =üìÆ= nor =üì§= consume the pipe from the stack,
for convenience, as most of the time you'll want to use it again.

Let's look at reading from a file:

#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both
[[file "bar"]] pipe-out
üì§ string
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
"foo" [[endpoint [[file "bar"]]]
       [in bytes]
       [out bytes]
       [type pipe]]
#+end_src

Note that the amount of bytes you'll get from a file on each take, is
limited. You will only get the entire contents if the file is
small. We'll want to repeatedly =üì§= until there's nothing left, and
put all the taken parts together.

Here's how we do it:
- turn the pipe that provides chunks of a file into a [[Generators][generator]], with =[take]=.
- Assemble the chunks with =reduce=. It requires a program to say how to
  combine the chunks. We want to =join= them, so the program is =[join]=.

We can also use the word =file-out= as a shortcut to get a pipe given a
file's name.
#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both
"bar" file-out liberator [üîó] fold string
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
"foo" [[endpoint [[file "bar"]]]
       [in bytes]
       [out bytes]
       [type pipe]]
#+end_src

Finally there's a convenient function to read a file into a string,
it's called =slurp=:

#+begin_src kcats
words [slurp] üîç

It actually drops the generator for you as well, since we know it's already
been fully read from. So you can do this:

#+begin_src kcats :results code :exports both
"bar" file-out slurp
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
"foo"
#+end_src

*** Coordination of simultaneous programs
**** Basics
The way kcats handles parallel processing (aka multithreading) is by
allowing you to create multiple environments, each with their own
programs, that run simultaneously.

Often you need the environments to communicate with each other, and
not just with the outside world. That's done with channels. Channels
let you send items from one environment to another.
**** Channels
Channels are a type of pipe. They are different from other pipes, like
files or network sockets, in that while files and sockets only deal
with bytes, channels can pass any kind of item (numbers, strings,
words, lists, and even other pipes). If you can put an item on the
stack, you can also pass it through a channel.  
***** Handoff
This is the most common type of channel. Think of it as a pipe with no
length or capacity. It's more like a hole in a thin wall, than an
actual pipe. You can pass items through the hole, but only if someone
is already on the other side waiting to take it. If your program tries
to pass an item through the handoff, but no other program running
simultaneously is already waiting to take it, your program will
*block*. That means it stops and waits. The same goes for receiving
items - if your program tries to receive but no one is sending yet,
your program will wait until someone sends. Handoffs support multiple
senders and receivers through the same "hole" - imagine multiple
people standing on either side of the wall, holding items they need to
pass through, and others empty handed waiting to receive. Only one
person can receive per send - it's a direct handoff and not a
broadcast.

You pass items from one environment to another by giving both
environments a copy of the handoff pipe. One environment calls =üìÆ=
(with an item) and the other calls =üì§=. If they're doing that at the
same time, the item moves from one environment to the other and both
the =üìÆ= and =üì§= complete at the same time.

You can pass as many items through the handoff as you want.
***** Buffered
This channel works similarly to a Handoff, but instead of having no
capacity, it has a fixed capacity that you specify when you create
it. Let's say you give it a capacity of 10. That means the sender can
put 10 items in, even when no one is receiving yet. On the 11th item,
sending will block just like a handoff would.

If a receiver takes an item out, that frees up space for one more item
that the sender can put in without blocking.
***** Signaling when you're done
It's common for a program to keep taking from a pipe until there's
nothing left to take, and then stop. How does it know there's nothing
left (in other words, nothing more will ever arrive, no matter how
long it waits)? With channels there's 2 ways to know:

+ One of the senders sends the item =üî≥=. All the standard library
  words that pull from a channel repeatedly, will stop when they
  receive =üî≥=.
+ All the senders copies of the channel are dropped. 

How is a sender dropped? That can happen several ways:

+ The channel item is dropped from the stack with the word =üóëÔ∏è= or
  its variants, or otherwise consumed.
+ The entire environment is dropped (as often happens when its program
  is finished)
+ A program receives on this copy of the channel. By default, channels
  are one direction only. Whichever operation you do first, drops the
  other side - so if you send first, the receiver is dropped, and vice
  versa. Bidirectional channels (where the same program can send and
  receive on the same channel) are theoretically possible, but
  currently not supported because they take a lot of care to use
  properly.

When writing a program that needs to know about the end of a stream,
you must take care to not leave extra copies of channels lying
around. Any extra channel copy that you don't =üóëÔ∏è= when finished, will
keep the stream open forever and can result in a *deadlock*. A deadlock
is when some program is waiting for a condition that can never
occur. In this case, a receiver is waiting for the end of the stream,
and it will never get it. The primary symptom of a deadlock is a
program that appears to be stuck or doing nothing, doesn't produce the
intended result, doesn't produce an error, and doesn't exit.

Note that it's also possible for receivers to signal they have
everything they want, by dropping their copy of the channel. After all
receivers are dropped, all senders will get errors when they try to
send.

**** Multiple environments
Parallel processing is done with multiple environments running
simultaneously, but how exactly do we set that up? And how do we
enable them to communicate with each other? How do we create two
environments with a copy of the same channel, so one can send and the
other receive?

One handy way is to use the word =spawn=. It takes a program and creates
a new environment, such that its program is the given program and the
stack is a copy of the current environment's stack. That way, you end
up with two environments, with different programs but the same stack.

Once the new environment is created, it doesn't actually do anything,
it's just another item inside the current environment. To make it
actually run the program, we need to =animate= it. At that point it
disappears from this environment and goes off on its own.

#+begin_src kcats
  handoff [5 üìÆ] fork animate üì§ 
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
5 [[capacity 0]
   [endpoint [[handoff 0]]]
   [out item]
   [receivers 1]
   [senders 0]
   [type pipe]]
#+end_src

Here we create a handoff, and then create a new environment that
inherits that handoff in its stack. That new environment will =üìÆ= the
number =5= into the channel. Then we call =üì§= on the other copy of the
channel to receive the number =5=.

Note that after we've received, the animated environment's program is
finished, so it is dropped. Its copy of the handoff is dropped along
with it, and that's why we see 1 receiver and 0 senders when we print
out our copy. The sender is gone. What can you do with this handoff
now? Nothing. Once all the senders or receivers are gone, you can no
longer use it. You can examine it to see that it's used up.

Note also, that when you =animate= a new environment, you can't debug it
using the same debugging tools we saw earlier. You actually lose all
contact with it, except for whatever pipe communication you program it
to do. Debugging simultaneous programs is a bit more involved than
debugging simple programs. This topic will be covered later.
**** Example
We'll show how parallel programming (multithreading) works in kcats,
with an example. Let's say we have a database of books, and we have 3
librarians checking in returned books. Let's say for simplicity that
*all* the books in the database were checked out and have now been
returned and are ready for checkin. We want to update the database so
that each book has a =last-checkin= property with the timestamp the
librarian processed it, and =checked-in-by= with the librarian's
name. We want all the books to be processed exactly once, with 3
librarians working in parallel.

We'll create chunks of our program and put it all together
later. Here's one chunk.  Let's read in our database and parse it into
a list:

#+begin_src kcats
"examples/books.kcats" file-out slurp read
#+end_src

So that's our database of unprocessed books. Now let's feed our
database into a pipe, in a separate environment. We could also have
used a buffered channel here.

#+begin_src kcats
  [[üìÆ] ü™ú ‚ñ∂Ô∏è] fork animate
  üóëÔ∏è ;; this copy of the library as the task to feed it is already running
#+end_src

Now we can create two channels - one to carry unstamped books (the input for the librarian), and one to
carry stamped books (the librarian's output). Then we create another pipe that gives the current time.
#+begin_src kcats
  handoff ;; a pipe for unprocessed books
  handoff ;; a pipe to collect completed work
  timestamps ;; pipe for the librarians to stamp their books with
#+end_src

Now we specify what each librarian should do. This is the meat of the
program. Note the use of the word =siphon= here. It takes a generator
and a pipe, and keeps generating items and putting them into the
pipe, until the end of the stream is reached (generator produces
=üî≥=).

#+begin_src kcats
  ;; the spawn prog should see: n ts po pi (librarian-name, timestamps, output-pipe, input-pipe)
  ;; the book each prog should see: book n ts po pi
  
  [4Ô∏è‚É£ 3Ô∏è‚É£ 2Ô∏è‚É£ ;; bind the 2-4th args
   [2Ô∏è‚É£ 1Ô∏è‚É£ ;; bind n, ts.
    [üì§ ‚Ä¢üóëÔ∏è ;; get a timestamp and then drop the ts pipe
     pair [checked-in-by last-checkin] label] ü™Ñ üîó] 
   [[üì§]] ü™Ñ ;; make a generator out of pi
   each ;; book, do the stamping
   üõü siphon] ;; from the each generator to the output pipe 
  üéí
  fork animate  ;; launch a separate environment

  ;; now that we've already captured the pipes to the workers we
  ;; can drop pi and ts
  ‚Ä¢üóëÔ∏è ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢üóëÔ∏è 
#+end_src

Now that we've specified what each librarian should do, we specify the
librarians. In this case, all we need is their name.
#+begin_src kcats
  ["Darlene" "Thomas" "Ethel"] ;; the names of the librarians
  swap map ;; for each librarian do the above program

  drop ;; the resulting list, we only care about launching envs
#+end_src

Finally we can just collect all the results from the output channel,
and drop the other items we don't need anymore, leaving just the results.

#+begin_src kcats
  [take] collect ;; the results
  ;; drop generator, leaving only results
  sink drop drop
#+end_src

Here's the whole program:

#+begin_src kcats
  handoff ;; a pipe for unprocessed books
  "examples/books.kcats" file-out slurp read ;; read the library

  ;; feed all the unprocessed books into a pipe, in a separate task
  [[üìÆ] ü™ú ‚ñ∂Ô∏è] fork animate
  üóëÔ∏è ;; this copy of the library as the task to feed it is already running
  handoff ;; a pipe to collect completed work
  timestamps ;; pipe for the librarians to stamp their books with

  ;; the spawn prog should see: n ts po pi (librarian-name, timestamps, output-pipe, input-pipe)
  ;; the book each prog should see: book n ts po pi
  [[[[üîÄ üì§ ‚Ä¢üóëÔ∏è ;; get a timestamp and then drop the ts pipe

* Contributing
** Issue reporting
Instead of opening a github issue, add a =TODO= subheading to the
[[*Issues][Issues]] heading. Commit the change and submit it as a pull request. In
the branch where that issue is being fixed, it will be changed to
=INPROGRESS=. When the issue is fixed, the heading will be
removed. (If you disagree that it's been fixed, submit a PR that
reverts the commit to remove it).

You can edit this file right on github, in your own fork of the
project, if you prefer.

Why do things this weird way? I don't want to rely on github, nice as
it is.

Please do report design improvements you'd like to see - for example,
inconsistencies in how words expect stack arguments to be, ways to
make the standard library easier to work with, etc.
* FAQ
** How do I keep track of what should be on the stack, as I write programs?
There's tooling planned that will help show what should be on the
stack at any point in a given program. However until that exists, you
can use comments to annotate your program line by line, and show what
is on the stack at each step.

See [[Prime factors]] example.

This is admittedly low tech, but it isn't as tedious as you might
first expect. You only have to pay attention to the stack items
actually touched by the code you're writing, which usually is rather
small - if you need to annotate a line with more than 5 or 6 items you
are probably doing something wrong. The solution could be to use an
association or list to hold multiple properties of the same conceptual
object, in one stack item.
** Why is there no word 'no' in kcats, but there is 'yes'?
The logic rules are that empty containers are 'negative', and every
other value is 'affirmative'. So the word =no=, by those rules would be
affirmative, which would be very surprising! So the word =no= is not
used in the language. To convey a logical negative, use empty list =[]=.
** I got an error, how do I diagnose the problem?
The first thing to do is check the contents of the error. The =unwound=
field will show you the instruction that failed along with the
remaining program. 

If that doesn't tell you enough about what's wrong (and it often
doesn't), there are several more tools at your disposal:

+ =dump= - this word prints the stack to stdout, if you add it to your
  program at strategic places, you can see if the stack looks the way
  you would expect at that point in the execution.
+ [[Debugging][built-in debugger]] - this allows you to step through program execution.
+ tracing - see [[List the steps of program execution]]
** kcats panics and exits, why?
This is due to a known unimplemented feature in the interpreter, or an
unknown bug. Please see [[Issues]], and if you don't see it there, please
add a new one and submit a pull request. Even for unimplemented
features it's good to let us know you need that feature so we can
prioritize it.

The goal is for kcats to never panic.
* Issues
** DONE Build without using emacs interactively
Users should not be required to know emacs to build the project, only
have it installed. The build should be accessible from bash without
having to use emacs interactively. 
** DONE Remove platform interop from lexicon
That was only there as a cheat when there was only the prototype
implementation. The platforms are different and their function names
don't belong in the lexicon.

I'm not even sure there should be platform interop at all - it doesn't
appear to be possible in the rust impl anyway.

So far what I've done is have some lower level words actually in the
dictionary but marked them like `++lookup`. I haven't decided what to
do about this yet. Lower level words probably should just be first
class citizens and I just need to think of better names. Right now the
low level (single-depth) lookup is `++lookup` and the user-facing
`lookup` does the arbitrary depth. In this case, the user-facing name
probably needs to change to reflect what it does (something like
`drill` or `extract`), and then the low level can just be `lookup`.

That means for all the i/o and crypto interactions, there needs to be
low-level words. I'm not sure yet how to prevent namespace pollution,
as one of the design choices is
** DONE 'unassign' doesn't take a keylist, only a single key
Should change to match =assign= and =lookup=, accept a list instead of
a single bare word.
** DONE More support for nested/related envs
Debuggers, spawning, ingesting etc
** TODO Graphical environment browser/editor 
It would be nice to have a graphical display of all the environments
in an application, and be able to 
+ Drill into the environment and read the stack/program/dictionary
+ Pause/resume execution
+ Apply debugging (breakpoint, step etc)
+ View pipes and what/where they connect to (draw lines if they
  connect somewhere else in the app)
+ Manually put things into pipes or take them out
+ Create new envs
+ Persist changes
+ Revert changes
** TODO Code distribution method
Let's say we write an app or library, how do we distribute it?

This ties in with durability - where do we store things in general,
and not just libraries? kcats does support the filesystem but I would
like that to be for compatibility only. The "native" kcats way of
storing and retrieving things should be via hash keys. There may also
be a fact database, probably with sparse tables (aka eavt format).

It brings up the question of what should "come with" the language. I
am thinking maybe there's a "barebones" version of the language with
no library management or anything. Then on top of that, build some
durability and networking to distribute code and other data. Then the
question is, what do we need to support in the base language? Seems
like there needs to be database/network functionality there, but
unused? Maybe make it a feature flag?

Let's explore the various options
*** Durability
It's tempting to want the flexibility of EAV (where there's basically
just one big db table with 3 columns and every attribute is a row).

However this may be a little hasty. Perhaps what we're really after
here is custom tables - the idea being that each user's db schema
might be different depending on what data is important to them.

We've basically got a database schema consensus problem. Maybe Alice
has a table CATS with columns SIZE COLOR AGE and Bob has a table CATS
with columns HEIGHT COAT-COLOR AGE. How do they share data? The two
tables are not really compatible without a specialized conversion tool
and even then some data would be missing. So Alice and Bob ideally
should agree on what a CATS schema is, otherwise they can't really
share CAT facts. The advantage of EAV might be that even if they had
different schemas they could stlil perhaps meaningfully talk about AGE
and possibly even COLOR (with a bit of intervention, or even another
fact that equates COLOR and COAT-COLOR in CATS).

The drawback of EAV is of course that it would perform rather terribly
as the database grows. I can't say for sure how many facts could
potentially be stored here, but here are some constraints:

+ Assume individual data only (no facebooks that store millions of
  people's data)
+ Assume popularity of the app (users may try to cram every fact they
  "know" into this db)
+ Assume there's some kind of garbage collection - Alice may collect
  weather observations or predictions constantly but doesn't need to
  keep old data. Maybe facts have a TTL? Not sure how that could be
  determined automatically.

 It's hard to estimate how large the db might get, but I suspect a
  lower bound of supporting 1M words is safe. As for upper bound,
  it's more difficult to say, but I would think the hardware limits of
  mobile devices would come into play. As of 2023 I think a db size on
  the order of 10gb would be approaching the device's capability
  limits, so maybe 100M words or so. I think it would be difficult
  to get an EAV database to perform well at that size, especially on
  mobile. Note datomic can handle that size so it's theoretically
  within reach.

  It may be possible to pick a standard db now (sqlite maybe) and not
  worry too much about performance. As long as the facts are portable
  to another db (which shouldn't be that hard), the issue can be
  revisited when it becomes an issue.

  Even using sqlite though, just building proper queries may be
  difficult. It may be possible to skirt that problem too and just do
  a minimal query to get a dataset that fits easily in memory and then
  post-process the rest. Let's say the query is "List all predictors
  (people who made predictions) and their accuracy", you could get all
  the unique predictor ids in a query, then one by one get all their
  predictions, then get all the relevant observations and compare
  them. Slow but not the type of query that will be done often, and
  possibly indexable.
**** Possible dynamic sql db
One possible design is to just use plain old sql (sqlite?) and create
normal tables. However the table names would be namespaced, possibly
with some sort of hash. That way, one person's "Customer" schema could
be in the same database as another person's without interfering.

So for example, the kcats language might need to keep track of library
dependencies. There could be a table =dependencies-01234abcd= with
columns =name=, =version=, =hash=, =blob= etc. Anything else wanting to use the
same schema could refer to it by hash. It would be possible to have
foriegn keys too.

One thing we want to avoid is having kcats users writing sql query
strings, that is not the idiomatic way of dealing with i/o. What
should happen is there's a =query= word that takes a program and db
descriptor of where the db is, and returns a pipe (where results come
out). The program is a "query equivalent" and would need to be
translated to sql and post-processed. This is very much nontrivial and
a naive implementation probably wouldn't perform well but we will try
it anyway. For example instead of writing

#+begin_src sql
  insert into Customers (name, age) values ("Bob", 25); 
  select * from Customers where name="Bob";
#+end_src

you'd write something like
#+begin_src kcats
  customers [[name "Bob"] [age 25]] put
  
  customers [[name] lookup "Bob" =] filter
#+end_src

and 
And then the translation would see we're selecting from customers,
then there's a filter. The filter might not translate to sql so it
will either just select all, or if it sees a certain format for the
predicate it can translate to a =where= clause. This is going to be
complex and bug prone but hopefully can be done in a way that the
worst case is poor performance and then iterate to get better
speed.


I suppose content distribution might need to be done
alongside this.

** DONE Clean up all the vector conversion
I've been calling =vec= a lot, sometimes just so the list will print
out with square braces. I now have a =repr= function that could do
this, so using =vec= for that purpose is no longer needed.

However, I can't get rid of all of them- for example, calling =conj=
on a vector vs list adds at different ends of the list so they are not
interchangeable in that respect. It may be dangerous to leave any
lists lying around if they might get conjed onto expecting it to go on
the end.

How do we write this code? Generally, how do we decide what order things go on the stack?

It looks like the array of bools is the main piece of data here, that
is used throughout the algorithm. The other commonly used variable is
p, the one that's incremented. I think probably p should remain on
top. The outermost loop needs to know when to stop, and that needs to
compare to num. That can go on the bottom.

The inner loop uses i. That should probably replace p on top when in use.
So it should be =[p a]= and later =[i a p]=.

Now that =lingo= exists, maybe should also write =let= for variables
(where the values are evaluated before updating the dictionary)?  Also
these aren't actually "variables" because you can't change the value,
without an inner =let=.

Actually this is probably best implemented in two parts:
+ a word that takes a set of bindings and evaluates the values,
  leaving a map of word to value
+ a word that takes the map above and inserts it into the
  dictionary. I think =lingo= does this already.

let's try to write the former here. I think we need =map-values= type of
thing here, which requires treating a map as a list.

** TODO FAQ entry about composability
kcats is difficult to use in the same mindset as other languages. The
amount of complexity you can fit into a single function or subroutine,
before it gets too difficult to reason about, is quite a bit
smaller. However kcats is designed to be used this way. The kcats way
is building small combinators, and then using those combinators to
build what you need.

kcats has some distinct advantages here:
+ The overhead of putting pieces together is basically zero, since
  function composition is the default.
+ Combinators are very easy to test independently.

kcats makes it easy to test combinators independent of the context
where you will use it. In purely functional code, this is
straightforward: you just place some sample data on the stack and then
the combinator you want to test, then run it.

With i/o it's not quite as straightforward. However kcats pipes are
designed to be easily swappable for regular values. Let's say you have
some code that expects to read from a file but you want to test it
without having to maintain state in your local filesystem:

#+begin_src kcats
  "bar" file-out
  take string
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
"Hello World!" [[type tunnel]
                [values [[type bytes]]]
                [to [[file "bar"]]]]
#+end_src

Swap the =file-out= pipe for a plain list of byte arrays, they
have the same interface, and gives the same result:
#+begin_src kcats
[#b64 "SGVsbG8gV29ybGQh"]
take string
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
"Hello World!" []
#+end_src

and of course you can build that byte array out of strings, if you prefer:

#+begin_src kcats
["Hello World!"] [encode] map
take string

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src kcats
"Hello World!" []
#+end_src

This technique works for any use case where you're using a pipe for
its usual take/put/step interface, and timing is not critical.

** TODO Inconsistent Type System :ai_lint:

The type system shows several inconsistencies:

    Some functions use specific types (number, string) while others use generic types (item a, item b)
    Some functions define both input and output types, while others only have input types
    Some functions have * as their output type without explanation
    The relationship between "traits" and types isn't clearly defined
** TODO Contradictory Security Model for Dictionary Modifications  :ai_lint: 

The documentation makes a strong statement:

One hard rule of kcats: "an environment cannot alter its own dictionary"

But later contradicts this:

kcats does support both temporarily and permanently monkey patching. See the words =define= for permanent and =lingo= for temporary.

This presents a fundamental inconsistency in how the language handles security and side effects.
** TODO AI model training from this documentation
While it's possible to train an AI model to write kcats using this
file unmodified, it's better to break it down into Q/A
flashcards. ChatGPT is pretty good at doing that, so if we need to
rerun that procedure, this is the prompt:

=== KCATS FLASH-CARD GENERATOR ===============================================

You are kcats-FCG, a tool that converts prose facts in the kcats manual
into instruction‚Äìanswer pairs for fine-tuning.

INPUT
  1. This context block (the part you are reading now).
  2. The full kcats documentation in Org-mode or Markdown.

TASK
  A. Parse the doc; ignore code blocks (`#+BEGIN_SRC`, triple-fence, etc.).
 
  B. Scan the prose (ignore code fences).

    Identify each and every distinct piece of instructional knowledge that helps a reader understand kcats, including (but not limited to)
    ‚Ä¢ purpose and goals
    ‚Ä¢ design (high & low)
    ‚Ä¢ conventions
    ‚Ä¢ limitations
    ‚Ä¢ behaviour (semantics, runtime, I/O)
    ‚Ä¢ techniques & idioms
    ‚Ä¢ standard-lib usage.

    A ‚Äúfact‚Äù F may be
    ‚Ä¢ a single sentence or
    ‚Ä¢ a tight group of consecutive sentences/headings that together express one idea.
    Treat ‚Äúidea-level‚Äù granularity as canonical; do not discard meaning that is split across sentences.

    Extract every such fact; do not skip ideas just because they are
    implicit, short, or follow immediately from the previous sentence or heading.
   
    Skip narrative, jokes, anecdotes.

  C. For each fact F generate 3 Q/A variants:

       Q1 (direct)  : Ask for the fact explicitly.
       Q2 (boolean) : A true/false or yes/no question whose
                      correct answer is an affirmation of F.
       Q3 (wh-word) : ‚ÄúWhy / How / Which / When ‚Ä¶‚Äù style paraphrase.

     Keep each question ‚â§ 120 characters; answers ‚â§ 200 characters.
     Do **not** invent extra facts; keep wording faithful but concise.

  D. Emit one JSON object per (question, answer) pair, newline-delimited:

     {"prompt": "<question>", "answer": "<answer>"}

     ‚Äì No additional fields.
     ‚Äì Escape double quotes and backslashes.
     ‚Äì End output with a final newline, no wrapper, no markdown fence.

OUTPUT
  Pure JSONL: many lines, each a single compact object as above.

EXAMPLE
  Fact  : ‚Äúkcats treats the empty list as false; any other value is true.‚Äù
  Lines :
  {"prompt":"What value is considered false in kcats?","answer":"The empty list (üî≥)."}
  {"prompt":"True or false: kcats has dedicated boolean literals.","answer":"False.  It uses the empty list as false and any other value as true."}
  {"prompt":"How does kcats represent truthiness?","answer":"Everything except the empty list is treated as true."}

NOTES
  ‚Ä¢ Keep Unicode (emoji) tokens intact.
  ‚Ä¢ Do NOT include runnable examples or stack traces; that corpus is built
    elsewhere.
  ‚Ä¢ Deterministic: if the same doc is given twice, produce the same cards
    in the same order (e.g. fixed template order Q1,Q2,Q3).

You are given multiple ‚Äústdlib entries‚Äù written in the kcats
(sexp-like) language.  Each entry looks like

  [<function-name or glyph>
     [[spec   ‚Ä¶]
      [doc    "‚Ä¶"]
      [definition [...]]     ;; present for user-defined words
      [examples [[[<prog1>] [<equivalent1>] "comment1"]
                 [[<prog2>] [<equivalent2>] "comment2"]
                 ‚Ä¶]] ] ] ]


Tasks
=====

1. Produce training rows in **JSON-Lines**.  
   Each line is a JSON object with the fields

        {
          "prompt":  "<prompt shown to the model during training>",
          "answer": "<the desired answer>"
        }

2. Emit two kinds of rows, all in the same stream:


   C. Definition-request rows  
      Only for entries that *have* a `[definition ‚Ä¶]` field (i.e. they
      are **not** axiom words).  Produce

         input  = "Write <glyph> in kcats."
         output = <definition>          (emit the s-expression exactly)

   D. Reverse-lookup rows  
      Also only for non-axiom words.  Re-phrase the doc as an
      instruction, answer with the definition.  Example pattern:

         input  = "Create a recursive programme that ‚Äúruns predicate,
                   exits when false, otherwise body then combinator‚Äù."
         output = <definition>

3. Keep the original ordering of lines for determinism:
      all rows of type A first (in the order the examples appear),
      then B, then C, then D.

4. Escape any inner quotation marks so the resulting JSON is valid.
   Do *not* pretty-print; one compact JSON object per line.

5. Do **not** wrap the whole output in an array, header, or
   explanation‚Äîonly the JSONL rows.

Example
=======

Input you will receive (shortened):

  [üë• [[spec ‚Ä¶]
       [doc "The twins denote copying the ToS."]
       [examples [[[1 2 3 üë•] [1 2 3 3] "Clone integer"]
                  [[üî≥ üë•]     [üî≥ üî≥]     "Clone Nothing"]]]]]

Expected JSONL you must emit:

{"input":"[1 2 3 üë•]","output":"[1 2 3 3]"}
{"input":"[üî≥ üë•]","output":"[üî≥ üî≥]"}
{"input":"What does üë• do?","output":"The twins denote copying the ToS."}

(There is no definition for üë•, so no rows of type C or D.)

That‚Äôs it‚Äîapply these rules mechanically for every entry you are
given and output the corresponding JSON-Lines.

* Roadmap Notes
** Higher level persistence abstraction
I wonder whether kcats should have any notion of files and sockets at
all. Sort of like java doesn't have any notion of memory addresses or
malloc/free - it operates at a higher level and handles mem management
for you. Maybe kcats handles persistence for you. This may be a sort
of chicken/egg problem where I need a network protocol to help w
persistence and I want that protocol to include kcats as a
language. Can they be bootstrapped as a single unit? Seems possible
but not easy. Persistence might involve having another party store
data for you, which might involve identity (to limit access) and money
(to incentivize someone to keep your data for later). That might be a
bit of a reach for a programming standard lib to handle.

And then there's the question of interop with other programs, how
would they communicate if kcats doesn't know what a file or socket is?
Maybe it can know what a file/socket is but you don't need to use it
except as interop (like clojure's java interop or java's jni).

So what would this look like?

Instead of telling the program *where* to persist, you just want it
persisted and you get a sort of claim check (maybe the hash of the
data?). Then to get it back later, you present the claim
check. Persistence is a best-effort deal (you can't be 100% sure no
disaster could wipe it out). So maybe also include some optional
params to indicate:

+ how long until you might need this again
+ how long you can wait between requesting it and getting it
+ how disaster-proof it needs to be
+ how much you're willing to pay to store it

Maybe we can even put messaging under this model - after all, sending
someone a message is in fact making a copy of data you have. You don't
necessarily want to retrieve it later though.

Computing might be better thought of as a worldwide resource - you
might not be able to trust someone else to do a computation for you
(yet, unless it's a specific type where you can verify without doing
the full computation yourself) but you can trust them with storage
(given enough redundancy - they can't steal your data because it's
encrypted).
** Object construction, caching
Often we create objects similar to java construction, where the input
and output are informationally equivalent (you can reconstruct the
output from the input anytime you want, and sometimes vice versa).

It might be nice if kcats didn't force you as a user to do this type
of operation and just let you use the original data.

For example, lets say you have =[[file "/tmp/foo"]]=. That's an
association of =file= (a type) to a string. Really what that means is
we're referring to a file on disk. In java we'd construct a =File=
object with =new File("/tmp/foo")=. It'd be nice if everywhere in
kcats you never needed a =File= object and could use the original
descriptor instead (or a pipe you've already created, if state
matters). On the jvm platform obviously somewhere a =File= object
would get created but that should be hidden from view. How would that
work?

I thought of a word like =derive= that caches these things? Maybe it
would keep a cache of previously derived things and just return the
answer if asked again (like memoized function in clojure and could
even be implemented that way). It would also have a mapping of *how*
to derive one thing from another. eg =[[file "foo"]]= and create a
pipe-in to write to it. You'd first need an inputstream to the file
(as inputstream is what the pipe protocol is actually using).

The thing is, inputstreams are not values. They're stateful, pointers
to places on disk. So we probably can't cache them nor need to.

=derive= would be more for things like crypto keys created from a
seed.

For pipes, we need to go from a descriptor, to some platform specific
object, to a pipe. How do we keep platform specific code isolated? I'm
hesitant to make public abstractions for anything but pipes. I don't
want a =file= word that creates file objects from descriptors, kcats
users should never see that. The only solution I can think of is to
just leave the platform-specific code where it is, and have some kind
of switching mechanism like clj/cljs has.
